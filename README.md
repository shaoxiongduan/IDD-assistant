# ZhiXin â€“ A RAG-based Virtual Assistant for Persons with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities

This is the code and data repository for the ZhiXin chatbot, a RAG LLM system fine-tuned to help the parents of children who have intellectual and developmental disabilities.

# Huggingface Models

The ZhiXin model and the embeddings are fine-tuned variants of the [Qwen2-7B-Instruct](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2) and [BCEmbedding](https://github.com/netease-youdao/BCEmbedding) models.

# More Info

Through interviews with organizations and social workers, I compiled information about various disadvantaged groups and their needs, including:

- Visually impaired individuals
- Elderly people
- Children from low-income families
- Students from remote regions

I've summarized their needs and my observations in [this file](./data/survey_overview.xls). If you'd like to help or share ideas, please reach out via email. As Helen Keller said, "Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much!"
