As of 2018, among local DPFs, 69.3% of municipal-level DPFs and 49.8% of county-level DPFs had staff members with disabilities. 146 As a step forward, in 2021, CDPF and four other ministries and departments issued a policy guidance regarding employing persons with disabilities in state organs, public institutions, and state-owned enterprises, explicitly requiring public sector employers to reasonably define the physical exam requirements for candidates with disabilities, and must not judge the candidates ’ health on the basis of their disability. 147 \n5. CRPD-compliant budgeting and financial management \nThere are three main mechanisms for the Chinese government to fund disability-related programs: regular public budget, special subsidy, and disability employment security fund (DESF). 148 From 2013 to 2017, the fiscal allocations from all levels of the government for persons with disabilities added up to over CNY 180 billion. 149 In 2021, the national public budget expenditure on disability affairs was CNY 70.6 billion, taking up 0.287% of the total national general public budget expenditure (24567.3 billion). 150 Compared to the scale of Chinese government budget (50-70 billion CNY per year), budgets of ongoing national development and humanitarian programs funded by international development partners are negligible. \nThe expenditures on disability affairs in 2021 included 30.6 billion on living and care subsidies (43.3%), 7.2 billion on rehabilitation, 6.6 billion on employment and poverty reduction, 5.5 billion on administrative costs, and 18.8 billion categorized as other expenditures. 151 In addition, CNY 16.1 billion of national public budget was spent on special education, 0.43% of the total education expenditures (3746.9 billion). 152 Article 48 of the 2017 Regulations on the Education of Persons with Disabilities stipulates that “ the financial funds allocated for compulsory education by local people ’s governments at all levels, as well as extra charges for education collected by these governments, shall have a certain proportion set aside for compulsory education for children and adolescents with disabilities. ” 153 Yet the proportion is not specified. \n146于娣.(2020).中国特色残联组织功能研究(博士学位论文,武汉理工大学). \nMost funding allocated for educating persons with disabilities are spent on special schools, and inclusive education in regular schools lacks financial support. 154 In 2021, The Action Plan for Special Education Development (2021-2025), issued in 2022 by the MOE, intends to increase the average government expenditure on compulsory education for children with disabilities from 6,000 yuan per student now to 7,000 yuan by 2025. 155",
            "2023 marks the 15 th year since China has ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2008. The landscape of disability inclusion in China has been undergoing deep transformation. This Situational Analysis provides an overview of the five preconditions for disability inclusion, as defined by the United Nations Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNPRPD) — equality and non-discrimination, inclusive service delivery, accessibility, CRPD compliant budgeting, and accountability and governance; and three cross-cutting issues including participation, inequalities, and gender. For each area of inquiry, the analysis follows the research questions provided by the UNPRPD, in identifying the gaps and opportunities to inform future development programs. The analysis is primarily based on secondary literature review, supplemented with consultations, carried out between March 2023 and June 2023. \nEquality and Non-Discrimination: China has more than 80 laws and 50 administrative regulations directly related to the interests of persons with disabilities, and regularly updated its national strategy for disability since 1991. Translating these commitments into better inclusion requires efforts to better align disabilityrelated policies and laws with the social model of disability, meaningfully engage OPDs independent from the state in decision making, and fully implement accessibility, reasonable accommodations, and antidiscrimination provisions. Culturally, the charity or medical model of disability remains dominant in public attitudes. \nAccessibility: China has issued more than 450 regulations, rules and normative documents on accessibility implementation and management. In recent years, campaigns are carried out to improve access to information. A further welcoming development is the new Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, passed on June 28, 2023. The effects of these policies depend on strong enforcement, sufficient remedies, and the meaningful engagement of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessibility tools and rules, with considerations of diverse needs among marginalized communities, such as deaf people/persons with hearing impairments, persons with intellectual disabilities, and persons with psychosocial disabilities. \nInclusive Service Delivery: Among 85 million officially estimated persons with disabilities, 38 million (44.7%) hold a disability certificate as of 2021. The task for service provision is daunting given the huge and diverse demands, and China has reached impressive coverage of services, especially in social protection and rehabilitation. To better align with the CRPD, the next step is to shift the focus from welfare provision to social inclusion, from special needs to inclusive services. This would require better rights awareness, accessibility, and reasonable accommodations in mainstream services, such as health, education, and employment; stronger support for caregiving instead of demanding family responsibilities; and more equitable allocation of resources for marginalized communities, such as persons with disabilities in rural areas, persons with severe or multiple disabilities, women with disabilities, and persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: According to the Ministry of Finance, in 2021, the national public budget expenditure on disability affairs was CNY 70.6 billion, roughly 0.287% of the total national general public budget expenditure. Majority of the disability budget (43.3%) was spent on living and care subsidies. Inclusive services such as inclusive education and employment, as championed by the CRPD, need stronger financial support. \nAccountability and governance: The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recommends an independent mechanism appointed to monitor the implementation of the CRPD. The CDPF regularly collects data from disability certificate holders and publishes annual updates in its key mandates, yet the data is not specifically aligned with the definition of disability or priority areas of the CRPD or SDGs. Data disaggregated by disability in mainstream statistical efforts need enhancement.",
            "Rehabilitation \nRehabilitation services are stipulated by the Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities (2017). Rehabilitation services are mainly delivered through the health system, DPF system, and the civil affairs system. Children aged 0-6 are prioritized, and offered full coverage of rehabilitation services. 78 As of 2017, 65.6% of persons with disabilities had access to rehabilitation services. 79 In 2021, 47.8% of those receiving rehabilitation services are persons with physical disabilities, and another 18.5% are people with psychiatric disabilities. 80 In recent years, progress has been made to expand rehabilitation from centralized medical rehabilitation to community-based rehabilitation by OPDs and self-help groups. 81 OPDs consulted call for more rehabilitation services aimed at community inclusion such as in educational or vocational settings. \nAssistive Technologies \nPublic provision of assistive devices are delivered through CDPF ’s rehabilitation departments and the civil affairs system. In 2017, 2.4 million persons with disabilities received assistive devices, 82 including white canes, vision-assistive devices, wheelchairs, prosthetic limbs, hearing aids, and cochlear implants. Consultations show that gaps exist in obtaining affordable, accessible, usable, and customized assistive devices for persons with disabilities. Currently, most assistive devices are still delivered through the government ’s centralized planning, which resulted in the lack of customization, preference for products with lower bidding price over quality, and rigid restrictions for eligibility. 83 In recent years, cash subsidies for assistive technologies of the users ’ own choice are being piloted in places like Beijing, Liaoning, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. 84 Many user-friendly assistive technologies provided by private sector remain unaffordable for most persons with disabilities without subsides from the government. \nCare Services \nOfficially, care services for persons with disabilities include home-based care, day care, and residential care services, targeting people with intellectual, psychosocial disabilities, and people with severe physical disabilities. 85 National standards were set in 2019. 86 Some care facilities offer “ assistive employment ” programs for both rehabilitation and employment purposes through low skill labor such as handicraft making. As of 2021, 608988 disability certificate holders are residing in 11,278 institutionalized care services nationwide, including boarding institutions, day care, and more comprehensive facilities. 87 Consultation shows that the care responsibility mostly falls on family members, especially women, with little alternative options, but some policies continue to encourage a family-centered care approach. \nFor mental health care, data on the proportion of government budget spent on institutionalized care versus community-based support are not available. 88 Although specific plan and timeline to transition to community-based support (as per the CRPD) is unknown, China is promoting community-based rehabilitation for persons with psychosocial disabilities, setting the goal to cover at least 80% of counties across the country by 2025. 89",
            "7.2 Inclusion of marginalised groups \nPeople with disabilities with low income \nThe correlation between poverty and disability is globally known, and China is no exception. Officially, over 7 million persons with disabilities have been lifted out of absolute poverty by 2021. 172 Yet persons with disabilities remain economically marginalized. Depending on the evaluation criteria, experts estimate that 36% to 44% of certified persons with disabilities in China can be considered under “ relative poverty. ” 173 As a CDPF official points out, households of persons with disabilities persistently earn less than 60% of the national average, and the gap continues to widen (see Figure 2). 174 \nHouseholds of persons with disabilities typically have “ high costs, low income. ” In 2018, healthcare expenses of families of persons with disabilities make up 26.3% of total household expenditures, 1.6 times that of the national average. The Engel's Coefficient (food expenditure to overall expenditure ratio) of persons with disabilities was as high as 40.9% in 2018, significantly higher than the national average (28.4%). 176 The least well-off among people with disabilities live in rural areas. In 2018, urban households of persons with disabilities earned 1.7 times more than rural households. Among the rural population with disabilities, over half have severe disabilities (holders of Level 1 or Level 2 certificates). 177 This indicates a greater gap in meeting their needs for care, accessibility, rehabilitation, assistive devices, basic public services, and work, exacerbating their poverty. \nPeople with intellectual and/or psychosocial disabilities People with intellectual disabilities fare the worst economically among all persons with disabilities. In 2018, the average personal annual income for people with intellectual disabilities was CNY 11,388.3, roughly 70% of the income of people with physical disabilities, the highest income group. Their average salary income was a mere CNY 1,600.4 per year, lowest among all persons with disabilities, indicating their lack of access to formal employment opportunities. 178 In consultation, parents are the primary caregivers of persons with intellectual disabilities. They lack support from the government and alternative options for caregiving, and are concerned about the absence of affordable, high-quality care as they reach older age or pass away. \nFor people with psychosocial disabilities, an early analysis based on the 2006 disability sample survey data found that “ psychiatric disability, ” as defined by Chinese law, was significantly correlated with poverty. 179 Expert informants are concerned that institutional paternalism and stigma has led to substituted decisionmaking instead of supported decision making that respects the person ’s autonomy, lack of recognition of legal capacity, and restricted social participation of persons with psychosocial disabilities. Although China ’s Mental Health Law stipulates the right to litigation and the principle of voluntary diagnosis and hospitalization, in judicial practices, persons with psychosocial disabilities still lack decision-making power and court decisions continue to emphasize the role of legal guardians and family members. 180 The scarcity of high-quality community-based services is also a reality.",
            "gital literacy of persons with disabilities. \n4. Inclusive Service Delivery \n4.1 Disability assessment and referral systems \nChina ’s current disability determination system does not align with the CRPD ’s social model definition of disability, or the WHO classification system. The Classification and Grading Criteria for Disability (GB/T 26341-2010) provides national standards for six types of disability, namely visual impairment/blind, Hearing impairment/deaf, Physical disability, Speech disability, Intellectual disability, and Psychiatric disabilities, with four grades under each type. Legal determination of disability is conducted by designated medical institutions, and the recognition of disability comes in the form of a certificate issued by the CDPF, which is a prerequisite for applying for disability subsidies and functions as an identification to access a range of benefits and services. Early i dentification and intervention mechanisms for children aged 0-6 are promoted by the N ational Disability Prevention Action Plan (2021-2025) and the Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities (2017). In 2021, 278,695 children with disabilities received basic rehabilitation services nationwide. 66 Quality of the services, disaggregated by type of disabili"

            "Cross-cutting issues: The CDPF and its networks, ministries, OPDs, parent groups, CSOs, development partners, academia, and private sector form a vibrant sector working on the issue of disability in China. The challenge is to strengthen meaningful coordination within the government, and between OPDs and different stakeholders, especially when the social model of disability is not yet the consensus, resulting in scattered resources devoted to divergent, sometimes opposing, directions. Women with disabilities account for 49.33% of the total population with disabilities. Women face continued barriers in equal opportunities to education and employment, sexual and reproductive health, and marriage and social life. Further, voices of persons with disabilities and their representative groups, remain marginalized in the decision making, policy making, and humanitarian and development programming about disability. Among them, persons with disabilities in rural areas, persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities, and women with disabilities, are most disadvantaged. \nThis Situational Analysis reaffirms the importance of close partnerships between stakeholders, and the leadership of OPDs in making decisions about disability towards inclusion. Key recommendations of the report include: building meaningful mechanisms to enhance OPD participation that combines OPDs ’ expertise and other stakeholders ’ access to policy making; strengthening partnerships with specific government departments beyond its disabled persons ’ federations (DPFs) 1 , especially at local levels; and leveraging ongoing policy windows in accessibility, employment, and health.",
            "Approach \nGuiding principles \nTaking a rights-based approach rooted in the CRPD, this report follows the UNPRPD ’s framework of five preconditions for disability inclusion, namely, equality and non-discrimination, inclusive service delivery, accessibility, CRPD compliant budgeting, and accountability and governance; and three cross-cutting issues including participation, inequalities, and gender. \nThe research team follows the principle “ nothing about us without us ” in the design, implementation, and consultations of the situational analysis, ensuring the direct involvement of national and local organizations of persons with disabilities (OPDs), unofficial self-help groups of persons with disabilities, as well as individuals with disabilities. The core research team consists of members of a national OPD and an individual consultant in close coordination with the UNPRPD Taskforce in China, comprised of UNESCO, ILO, UNFPA, UN Women, and WHO. \nDespite time constraints, the research team strived to leverage the analysis as an opportunity to enhance relationships with and among stakeholders, bringing together government stakeholders, UNCT, and OPD leaders since the work plan design phase. Drafts of the report were sent to the UNCT, key government stakeholders, and OPDs for review, to ensure they are informed and involved in the analysis process. \nMethodology \nThis report followed the research questions listed in the “ UN PRPD guidance for conducting a situational country analysis of the rights of persons with disabilities. ” The analysis took place from March 2023 to June 2023. Due to the condensed timeframe of the analysis and the richness of existing literature, the analysis is primarily based on desk review of secondary literature and data, supplemented with key informant interviews, focus group discussions, an OPD preparatory workshop, and a multi-stakeholder consultation. \nFor desk research, the analysis draws comprehensively from existing literature on the preconditions of inclusion in China, ranging from the CRPD reviews, issue-based UN publications, government documents, official database and publications of the CDPF, articles published by OPDs, media reports, as well as Chinese and English language academic research. \nConsultations for the analysis focused on questions under-addressed by existing literature. Depending on stakeholders ’ accessibility preferences and availability, a mixture of consultation methods were adopted. The research team consulted in total 70 informants through in-person/online interviews, email questionnaires, focus group discussions, meetings, and soliciting written feedback and evidence. Email questionnaires and interviews were conducted with 33 OPDs, among which 42% of are unregistered grassroots groups, located in 18 different cities, working on promoting the rights of persons with physical, visual, intellectual, psychosocial, hearing, or multiple impairments, people with rare diseases, gender, and cross-disability issues. The team also interviewed and/or organized focus group discussions with 4 civil society organizations, and 5 government institutions, including the Education and Employment Department, Rights Protection Department, and Organizational and Liaison Department of the China Disabled Persons ’ Federation. Further, the research team reached out to 22 experts with domain-specific questions through written or online interviews, including scholars, lawyers, and UN agencies, among whom 6 are persons with disabilities. The draft report went through comprehensive reviews by 3 external experts, representing the perspectives of OPDs, policy makers, and development partners, with specializations in law, education, and OPD development. List of consulted stakeholders is not provided for protection of anonymity.",
            "Disclaimer \nThe data and information presented in the report are based on the situational analyses conducted at the country level. Methodology for data collection included a desk review of relevant literature, key informant interviews and focus groups, and consultative workshops with key stakeholders. The UNPRPD has not edited the report or verified the findings for accuracy. This report does not necessarily reflect the position of the UNPRPD MPTF.",
            "Scope and limitations \nThe Situational Analysis is a combination of consolidating existing data and consulting diverse opinions. It is therefore not an original research based on primary sources or raw data collection. The Situational Analysis is designed to inform future program design on disability inclusion under the framework of UNPRPD, not an expert opinion by the United Nations. \nThe analysis has revealed significant gaps in data availability, which means the data currently available is insufficient to answer the full range of analytical questions and topics covered in the UNPRPD framework. Some questions are insufficiently addressed due to the complexity and scale of the issue, unavailability of reliable data, or potential risks for stakeholders. A few questions are listed as suggestions for more comprehensive research in the future. \nAmong existing data, consistency in the definition of disability is not guaranteed. Government data tend to focus on registered organizations, and disability certificate holders which follows an impairment-based, biomedical definition of disability. Other studies may use informal channels to reach persons with disabilities and unregistered groups. \nIn light of the limited scope of the report, the analysis does not include all the information available for each focus area. It prioritizes addressing the questions listed in the UNPRPD Situational Analysis Guideline and identifying gaps and opportunities for future collaboration among multiple stakeholders. Conducted between March and June 2023, the analysis may not reflect the latest developments of this fast-changing field. \nThe majority of OPDs consulted for the report are urban, registered organizations, representing the interests of people with physical or visual impairments, cross disabilities, or parent groups of people with intellectual disabilities, including organizations led by women with disabilities; but less so for deaf organizations, self-advocates with intellectual disabilities or psychosocial disabilities. Further, voices of more marginalized persons with disabilities, such as those living in rural areas, or with multiple/severe disabilities, are largely reflected through secondary literature and data. Like other studies, those who were able to respond to our consultation are tip of the iceberg that are already active and expressive, but the vast majority of the most marginalized communities remain difficult to reach and their voices remain unheard.",

            "Analysis of key gaps and opportunities \nGaps \nEquality and non-discrimination: Attitudinal barriers are considered by stakeholders as one of the most fundamental challenges that cuts across all preconditions for inclusion. Progress has been made since the adoption of CRPD in 2008 in terms of awareness-raising of the social model of disability, especially among development partners and OPDs/CSOs. Yet the Chinese society at large and its corresponding systems are predominantly taking a medical model approach to disability, regarding persons with disabilities as subjects of charity and welfare in need of special rather than mainstream services. Policy makers and service providers, especially at grassroots levels, lack the awareness and buy-in of CRPD or the social model of disability. Laws and regulations relevant to disability are not fully aligned with the CRPD, and lack strength in enforcement and remedies. \nInclusive Service Delivery: The current policy frameworks tend to regard persons with disabilities as welfare beneficiaries more than rights holders. Public provision of disability support services prioritize social protection, subsidies, and rehabilitation, less focused on building support systems for the equal participation of persons with disabilities in society, such as inclusive education and employment. Policy makers are incentivized to maximize service coverage for the large population of persons with disabilities with limited resources, de-emphasizing the quality of services. The agency and autonomy of persons with disabilities is downplayed. As reflected in multi-stakeholder consultations, OPDs are concerned about the policy focus on family ’s responsibility in caregiving for persons with disabilities, without sufficient government support. \nAccessibility: Unchecked discrimination against persons with disabilities, combined with the lack of reasonable accommodations and accessibility, pose consistent barriers in all aspects of social participation of persons with disabilities. Despite increased government investment in accessibility, weak enforcement, insufficient remedies, and the lack of meaningful participation of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessible tools and standards has resulted in the poor quality of accessibility measures. As shown in the draft Law on the Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, there is also a tendency to prioritize physical environment over access to information and service provision, especially for persons with intellectual or psychosocial impairments, and deaf people/persons with hearing impairments. \nAccountability and Governance: Disability has not yet been mainstreamed into the current governance structure. The CDPF system is assigned the responsibility for disability inclusion but with insufficient authority to coordinate with other ministries. This relatively segregated coordination mechanism within the government, according to stakeholders consulted, can form barriers for OPDs to engage mainstream ministries and obtain resources from the government which are concentrated within the DPF system. Consistent data collections on disability inclusion aligned with the CRPD and SDGs are lacking. Official statistics on disability adopt impairment-based definitions of disability and does not comply with the ICF or CRPD definitions of disability. Further, stakeholders are concerned about the reliability of self-reported data, the transparency of data, and the lack of disaggregated data by disability in mainstream data collections. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: Despite the much larger size compared to development partners, government budgeting prioritizes welfare provision over rights protection, and special rather than mainstream services. Significant power and resource imbalances exist between the duty bearers and rights holders. While development partners are reducing support for countries like China as its income level grows, development programs funded by foreign entities are under increasing legal and administrative scrutiny. This has impacted the development of independent OPDs which lack access to government resources.",
            "Background \nPurpose of analysis \nThe UN Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (PRPD) is dedicated to the implementation of the CRPD, by bringing together different UN entities, governments, persons with disabilities and civil society for the purpose of joint programming and partnerships. To better support countries, the PRPD believes it is necessary to understand what the main bottlenecks and priorities are in each country in relation to the fulfilment of the CRPD. This Situational Analysis was developed as a requirement of the inception phase of the fourth call for proposals of the UNPRPD Multi-Partner Trust Fund (UNPRPD MPTF). Key objectives of the 4 th call include advancing CRPD implementation at country level by focusing on the preconditions for disability inclusion across sectors, and improving the implementation of disability inclusive SDGs at the country level. The main goal of the situational analysis is to inform the design of future cross-sector PRPD programs in China, with the report serving as a baseline. The analysis also aims to build working relationships between UN entities, government, OPDs, other civil society organizations, private sector and academia, as a basis for future co-design of programs; to strengthen the capacity of above stakeholders to include and address the rights of persons with disabilities more effectively; and to inspire disability inclusion adjustments in ongoing UN programs and processes. \nIntroduction to disability in China \nOfficially, China is home to 85 million persons with disabilities, roughly 6% of the total population. The most recent national survey on disability (2006) found that 17.8% of households in China had family members with disabilities. 75.04% of persons with disabilities resided in rural areas, 53.24% were above 60 years old, and 51.55% were men. 2 China ’s Law on the Protection of Disabled Persons (LPPD) defines a person with disabilities as “ one who has abnormalities of loss of a certain organ or function, psychologically or physiologically, or in anatomical structure and has lost wholly or in part the ability to perform an activity in the way considered normal. ” Based on this definition, six categories of disability are certified, including visual disabilities, hearing disabilities, physical disabilities, speech disabilities, intellectual disabilities, and psychiatric disabilities, with four grades under each category. By 2021, 38 million persons with disabilities held a disability certificate, among whom 22 million were men, and 30.1 million were registered as rural residents. 3 Among the disability certificate holders, 18.7% were illiterate, 40.3% received primary education, and 30.3% went to middle school. 4 \nThe China Disabled Persons Federation (CDPF), a semi-governmental mass organization with vice-ministry level status, was founded in 1988, marking significant national commitment to disability issues. 5 The CDPF ’s mission is to “ represent, serve, and manage ” persons with disabilities across China. 6 By 2018, a 4中国残疾人联合会.

            "Approach \nGuiding principles \nTaking a rights-based approach rooted in the CRPD, this report follows the UNPRPD ’s framework of five preconditions for disability inclusion, namely, equality and non-discrimination, inclusive service delivery, accessibility, CRPD compliant budgeting, and accountability and governance; and three cross-cutting issues including participation, inequalities, and gender. \nThe research team follows the principle “ nothing about us without us ” in the design, implementation, and consultations of the situational analysis, ensuring the direct involvement of national and local organizations of persons with disabilities (OPDs), unofficial self-help groups of persons with disabilities, as well as individuals with disabilities. The core research team consists of members of a national OPD and an individual consultant in close coordination with the UNPRPD Taskforce in China, comprised of UNESCO, ILO, UNFPA, UN Women, and WHO. \nDespite time constraints, the research team strived to leverage the analysis as an opportunity to enhance relationships with and among stakeholders, bringing together government stakeholders, UNCT, and OPD leaders since the work plan design phase. Drafts of the report were sent to the UNCT, key government stakeholders, and OPDs for review, to ensure they are informed and involved in the analysis process. \nMethodology \nThis report followed the research questions listed in the “ UN PRPD guidance for conducting a situational country analysis of the rights of persons with disabilities. ” The analysis took place from March 2023 to June 2023. Due to the condensed timeframe of the analysis and the richness of existing literature, the analysis is primarily based on desk review of secondary literature and data, supplemented with key informant interviews, focus group discussions, an OPD preparatory workshop, and a multi-stakeholder consultation. \nFor desk research, the analysis draws comprehensively from existing literature on the preconditions of inclusion in China, ranging from the CRPD reviews, issue-based UN publications, government documents, official database and publications of the CDPF, articles published by OPDs, media reports, as well as Chinese and English language academic research. \nConsultations for the analysis focused on questions under-addressed by existing literature. Depending on stakeholders ’ accessibility preferences and availability, a mixture of consultation methods were adopted. The research team consulted in total 70 informants through in-person/online interviews, email questionnaires, focus group discussions, meetings, and soliciting written feedback and evidence. Email questionnaires and interviews were conducted with 33 OPDs, among which 42% of are unregistered grassroots groups, located in 18 different cities, working on promoting the rights of persons with physical, visual, intellectual, psychosocial, hearing, or multiple impairments, people with rare diseases, gender, and cross-disability issues. The team also interviewed and/or organized focus group discussions with 4 civil society organizations, and 5 government institutions, including the Education and Employment Department, Rights Protection Department, and Organizational and Liaison Department of the China Disabled Persons ’ Federation. Further, the research team reached out to 22 experts with domain-specific questions through written or online interviews, including scholars, lawyers, and UN agencies, among whom 6 are persons with disabilities.

            "re. Additionally, we controlled neuroticism to better understand the mental health of parents during the pandemic. To increase the validity of the results, other variables can be added in future studies. Finally, because the data collection took place during the pandemic, without further data collection, we cannot know the long-term impact of discrimination amid the pandemic on the respondents’ psychological distress. Future studies can utilize random sampling strategies with multiple data collection in order to study the impact of discrimination over time.5. ConclusionsIn summary, some parents of special needs children had mental health problems during the pandemic. There were significant differences in the mental health of parents depending on the child’s disability. Overall, the behavioral problems of children and the psychological demands of parents were common factors predicting the mental health of all parents. Parent–child dysfunctional interactions and parenting distress were associated with parents of children with autism spectrum disorder. Family support, difficult child, and parenting distress were associated with parents of children with an intellectual disability. It is therefore necessary to provide more social and family support to reduce pressure on parents.AcknowledgmentsWe sincerely thank all the respondents for participating in this study.Author ContributionsThe study was designed by J.R. and S.-Q.C.

            "1.5 International Cooperation (UN Agencies, Donors) \nUNPRPD China Programme was implemented from 2014 to 2020. As a result of the Programme, the UN Country Team in China formed and institutionalized the UN Theme Group on Disability (UNTGD), a comprehensive, multi-stakeholder platform composing of over 100 key stakeholders for open dialogue and advocacy on the needs and rights of persons with disabilities in China. The UNTGD aims to consolidate the efforts and foster consultation and collaboration of its members including UN agencies and external disability stakeholders, in supporting the government in fulfilling its commitments to the CRPD and in achieving national goals on ensuring the equal rights of persons with disabilities. \nThe UNTGD is positioned to support the effective implementation of UN ’s collective commitments and actions in the new UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF), and to strengthen the UN ’s accountability towards disability inclusion in response to the Disability Inclusion Scorecard. The UNRCO and all UN agencies have respectively assigned a disability focal point as UNTGD member. The following agencies are especially engaging in advancing the rights of persons with disabilities with specific focuses relevant to their respective mandates: \n• UNESCO: inclusive education, information accessibility, promotion of disability inclusion through and in media and culture, media and information as well as digital literacy \n• UNICEF: inclusive education, accessible and child-friendly environment, social protection for children with disabilities, inclusive child welfare and protection services, public awareness raising and advocacy on disability inclusion. \n• UNFPA: strengthen universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) and GBV information and services, and advocate disability data generation \n• UNDP: access to justice for persons with disabilities \n• ILO: employment and decent work for persons with disabilities \n• UN Women: Research on gender gaps between men with disabilities and women with disabilities and support the advocacy of the rights of women and girls with disabilities \nNo other UN agencies ’ joint programs supporting legislative reforms, policy development or other relevant national programs that are important for persons with disabilities are available. \nThe knowledge and understanding of UN agencies staff on disability inclusive programming have been gradually enhanced in recent years, especially among the staff members from the agencies that are closely involved in the capacity building activities and joint programmes and activities on disability inclusion. Key trainings include: a half-day meeting and discussion on disability equality for UN staff held on 1 August 2018, participated by 18 UN colleagues from 10 UN agencies; a Disability Equality Training workshop for UNCT held in 2019 to strengthen the UNCT ’s capacity to ensure a human rights-based approach to disability is reflected in their work at all times, participated by 16 representatives from six UN agencies; a knowledge sharing session at the regular meeting of the UN Communications Group in China on media communications for promoting disability equality in China held in 2021, participated by communication officers from 20 UN agencies; and the six-day Induction workshop held under the UNPRPD 4th Funding Call Inception Phase in November-December 2022, participated by six colleagues representing 5 UN agencies, including UNESCO, ILO, UNFPA, WHO, UN Women and FAO.",

            "The situation and rights of persons with disabilities is incorporated into the Common Country Analysis, UNSDCF and Joint Work Plans in full consultation with the UNTGD. As a result, the UNSDCF 2021-2025 has integrated disability inclusion by setting the commitment to “ leaving no one behind ” as one of its guiding principles and explicitly identifying persons with disabilities as one o f the groups more at risk of being left behind in China. Persons with disability are particularly referenced in parts related to rehabilitation services, full social inclusion, development, and legitimate rights and interests. Besides, UNSDCF also specifically stipulates that the participation of CDPF in the review and implementation of the UNSDCF will be made at the level of the Results Groups. \nSpecifically, under the UNSDCF Strategic Priority 1 “ People and Prosperity: Achieving innovation-driven, coordinated and shared development ”, Outcome 2 reads, “ People ’s lives in China are improved further as headways is made in ensuring access to childcare, education, healthcare services, elderly care, housing, and social assistance, and more people in China, including left-behind groups, benefit from equitable and high quality public services and social protection systems as well as accelerated efforts to reduced gender inequality and other forms of social inequality throughout the life-course. ” \nThe UN makes an effort to engage persons with disabilities and their representative organizations closely across ongoing programs at country level. One attempt was to make the UN premises more accessible. An assessment on the accessibility of the physical environment and services of all UN premises in China has been completed with support of the Accessibility Development Institute of Tsinghua University in 2021, with detailed recommendations provided for improvement. \nUNTGD provides a platform for international development partners to engage with OPDs. Currently, a few bilateral and multilateral donors such as the European Commission and British Council still have programs on disability. However, consultations show that international cooperation is increasingly scrutinized by authorities, and OPDs and local stakeholders are cautious about such engagement. \n1.6 Other Key Stakeholders (Academic, Private sector): Academic institutions or think tanks play an important role in the sector, due to their access to policy making channels. However, not all academics are aligned with the CRPD. OPDs are concerned that some academic institutions regard disability as an object of research but do not meaningfully engage OPDs, displacing rather than amplifying the voices of persons with disabilities. \nPrivate sector is increasingly active in disability inclusion, due to shifting funding structure for OPDs/CSOs, domestic policy incentives for disability-inclusive employment and services, and global corporate cultural change towards Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), and corporate social responsibility (CSR). A few social enterprises have been active in engaging the private sector. However, balancing the interests of business clients and the disability community is a challenge, which needs to involve different stakeholders, including government, disability advocates, and businesses themselves. A missed opportunity identified by informants is the lack of engagement with OPDs, reinforcing the fragmentation of limited resources of the field. Further, most businesses still lack the awareness of the social model of disability, taking a charity-based or tokenistic approach.",

Most working women, on the other hand, received no support on workplace accessibility and reasonable accommodation, and 44.7% of them did not receive equal pay for equal work. Over half of the informants reported personal income as lower than CNY 2000 per month. 36.3% of women surveyed in 2020 experienced loss of income due to COVID-19. 188 \nIn 2020, the CDPF, supported by UN ESCAP, UN Women, UNFPA, and Rehabilitation International, released a “ Call to Action: Enabling Sisters with Disabilities to Join in Shaping the Future We Want ” in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action at the Fourth World Conference on Women, and the fifth year of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Promoting adequate standard of living, health, and education of women and girls with disabilities are among the top of the list of call for actions.

            "Background \nPurpose of analysis \nThe UN Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (PRPD) is dedicated to the implementation of the CRPD, by bringing together different UN entities, governments, persons with disabilities and civil society for the purpose of joint programming and partnerships. To better support countries, the PRPD believes it is necessary to understand what the main bottlenecks and priorities are in each country in relation to the fulfilment of the CRPD. This Situational Analysis was developed as a requirement of the inception phase of the fourth call for proposals of the UNPRPD Multi-Partner Trust Fund (UNPRPD MPTF). Key objectives of the 4 th call include advancing CRPD implementation at country level by focusing on the preconditions for disability inclusion across sectors, and improving the implementation of disability inclusive SDGs at the country level. The main goal of the situational analysis is to inform the design of future cross-sector PRPD programs in China, with the report serving as a baseline. The analysis also aims to build working relationships between UN entities, government, OPDs, other civil society organizations, private sector and academia, as a basis for future co-design of programs; to strengthen the capacity of above stakeholders to include and address the rights of persons with disabilities more effectively; and to inspire disability inclusion adjustments in ongoing UN programs and processes. \nIntroduction to disability in China \nOfficially, China is home to 85 million persons with disabilities, roughly 6% of the total population. The most recent national survey on disability (2006) found that 17.8% of households in China had family members with disabilities. 75.04% of persons with disabilities resided in rural areas, 53.24% were above 60 years old, and 51.55% were men. 2 China ’s Law on the Protection of Disabled Persons (LPPD) defines a person with disabilities as “ one who has abnormalities of loss of a certain organ or function, psychologically or physiologically, or in anatomical structure and has lost wholly or in part the ability to perform an activity in the way considered normal. ” Based on this definition, six categories of disability are certified, including visual disabilities, hearing disabilities, physical disabilities, speech disabilities, intellectual disabilities, and psychiatric disabilities, with four grades under each category. By 2021, 38 million persons with disabilities held a disability certificate, among whom 22 million were men, and 30.1 million were registered as rural residents. 3 Among the disability certificate holders, 18.7% were illiterate, 40.3% received primary education, and 30.3% went to middle school. 4 \nThe China Disabled Persons Federation (CDPF), a semi-governmental mass organization with vice-ministry level status, was founded in 1988, marking significant national commitment to disability issues. 5 The CDPF ’s mission is to “ represent, serve, and manage ” persons with disabilities across China. 6 By 2018, a 4中国残疾人联合会.

            "Findings \n1. Stakeholder and coordination analysis \n1.1 Government \nLead ministries in ensuring the rights of persons with disabilities include the Ministry of Civil Affairs, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and the National Health Commission, which, together with the China Disabled Persons ’ Federation, form the core of the State Council Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work. Other important government stakeholders include National Bureau of Statistics, the Supreme People ’s Court, and the Supreme People ’s Procuratorate. As with SDGs, in 2016, China established an inter-ministerial coordination mechanism involving 45 government departments for SDG implementation, assigning the 17 goals and 169 targets to different departments according to their administrative responsibilities. 10 \nThe China Disabled Persons ’ Federation (CDPF) functions as the de facto whole-of-government disability focal point. It is a semi-governmental umbrella mass organization funded by the Chinese government to represent, serve, and supervise disability related affairs. Established in 1988, it now has a nationwide network of local branches across China, with about 90,000 full-time workers and 400,000 part-time staff members. 11 By 2018, a total of 42,000 disabled persons ’ federations (DPFs) had been set up across the nation. 12 \nThe Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work at all levels consist of ministry-specific disability focal points within government. At the State Council level, it is formed by focal points from 34 ministries, departments and organizations to coordinate the formulation and implementation of policies and programs in relation to persons with disabilities and address major disability-related issues. 13 The Committee is also responsible for coordinating major United Nations activities regarding disability affairs in China, including promoting the implementation of the CRPD. 14 The Committee ’s Secretariat is held by the CDPF ’s General Office. 15 At the local levels, the working committees mirror the same structure, usually chaired by the deputy head of the same level government, with focal points from various departments. 16 \nOfficial Associations: Under the supervision of the CDPF, there are five specialized national associations representing the interests of people with various types of disabilities: the China Association of the Blind, the China Association of the Deaf, the China Association of Persons with Physical Disabilities, the China Association of Persons with Intellectual Disability and their Relatives, the China Association of Persons with Psychiatric Disability and their Relatives. The five associations and its local branches operate as internal parts of the CDPF and its branches. 17 By 2018, there were a total of 16,000 branches of these 13 Ibid. \nassociations at provincial, municipal, and county levels. 18 In recent years, reform efforts have been made to register special associations as separate legal entities from the DPFs to enhance the professionalization of the associations. 19 Other state-affiliated mass organizations also play a role in domain-specific disability issues, such as All China Women ’s Federation, China Internet Society, and China Family Planning Association.",

            "1.5 International Cooperation (UN Agencies, Donors) \nUNPRPD China Programme was implemented from 2014 to 2020. As a result of the Programme, the UN Country Team in China formed and institutionalized the UN Theme Group on Disability (UNTGD), a comprehensive, multi-stakeholder platform composing of over 100 key stakeholders for open dialogue and advocacy on the needs and rights of persons with disabilities in China. The UNTGD aims to consolidate the efforts and foster consultation and collaboration of its members including UN agencies and external disability stakeholders, in supporting the government in fulfilling its commitments to the CRPD and in achieving national goals on ensuring the equal rights of persons with disabilities. \nThe UNTGD is positioned to support the effective implementation of UN ’s collective commitments and actions in the new UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF), and to strengthen the UN ’s accountability towards disability inclusion in response to the Disability Inclusion Scorecard. The UNRCO and all UN agencies have respectively assigned a disability focal point as UNTGD member. The following agencies are especially engaging in advancing the rights of persons with disabilities with specific focuses relevant to their respective mandates: \n• UNESCO: inclusive education, information accessibility, promotion of disability inclusion through and in media and culture, media and information as well as digital literacy \n• UNICEF: inclusive education, accessible and child-friendly environment, social protection for children with disabilities, inclusive child welfare and protection services, public awareness raising and advocacy on disability inclusion. \n• UNFPA: strengthen universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) and GBV information and services, and advocate disability data generation \n• UNDP: access to justice for persons with disabilities \n• ILO: employment and decent work for persons with disabilities \n• UN Women: Research on gender gaps between men with disabilities and women with disabilities and support the advocacy of the rights of women and girls with disabilities \nNo other UN agencies ’ joint programs supporting legislative reforms, policy development or other relevant national programs that are important for persons with disabilities are available. \nThe knowledge and understanding of UN agencies staff on disability inclusive programming have been gradually enhanced in recent years, especially among the staff members from the agencies that are closely involved in the capacity building activities and joint programmes and activities on disability inclusion. Key trainings include: a half-day meeting and discussion on disability equality for UN staff held on 1 August 2018, participated by 18 UN colleagues from 10 UN agencies; a Disability Equality Training workshop for UNCT held in 2019 to strengthen the UNCT ’s capacity to ensure a human rights-based approach to disability is reflected in their work at all times, participated by 16 representatives from six UN agencies; a knowledge sharing session at the regular meeting of the UN Communications Group in China on media communications for promoting disability equality in China held in 2021, participated by communication officers from 20 UN agencies; and the six-day Induction workshop held under the UNPRPD 4th Funding Call Inception Phase in November-December 2022, participated by six colleagues representing 5 UN agencies, including UNESCO, ILO, UNFPA, WHO, UN Women and FAO.",
            "• SDG 8.10: Implement the Plan for Promoting the Development of Financial Inclusion(2016-2020) to establish, by 2020, an inclusive financial services and security system to increase the accessibility of timely, affordable, and convenient financial services for the general public, especially for small and micro enterprises, farmers, urban low-incomers, poor people, people with disabilities and the elderly. By 2020, establish a modern insurance industry that is comprehensive, stable, well-functioning and credible. \n• SDG 10.3: Establish a more equitable and sustainable social protection system that better protect rights and interests of vulnerable social groups such as women, minors, and people with disabilities. \nIn China ’s Progress Report on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2021), persons with disabilities were reported as beneficiaries of China ’s progress on SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG4 (quality education), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). 190 In China ’s 2021 Voluntary National Review, people with disabilities are mentioned as beneficiaries of China ’s efforts in SDG 1.5, the world ’s largest social security system, and COVID response. No specific evidence was provided regarding the implementation of the disability-related goals listed in China ’s Action Plan. 191 There is no reference to OPD participation or capacity development support of OPDs in the Action Plan, Progress Report, or Voluntary National Review. \nThe UNSDCF (2021-2025) with China included disability-related support in “ Outcome 2: People ’s lives in China are improved further as headway is made in ensuring access to childcare, education, healthcare services, elderly care, housing, and social assistance, and more people in China, including left-behind groups, benefit from equitable and high-quality public services and social protection systems as well as accelerated efforts to reduce gender inequality and other forms of social inequality throughout the lifecourse. ” 192 The UNTGD is fully consulted in the country plans and strategies, processes and reporting. Other bilateral agencies and donors promote and engage in disability rights through their participation in the UNTGD meetings and activities, but most from disability-specific rather than disability mainstreaming perspectives.",
            "The situation and rights of persons with disabilities is incorporated into the Common Country Analysis, UNSDCF and Joint Work Plans in full consultation with the UNTGD. As a result, the UNSDCF 2021-2025 has integrated disability inclusion by setting the commitment to “ leaving no one behind ” as one of its guiding principles and explicitly identifying persons with disabilities as one o f the groups more at risk of being left behind in China. Persons with disability are particularly referenced in parts related to rehabilitation services, full social inclusion, development, and legitimate rights and interests. Besides, UNSDCF also specifically stipulates that the participation of CDPF in the review and implementation of the UNSDCF will be made at the level of the Results Groups. \nSpecifically, under the UNSDCF Strategic Priority 1 “ People and Prosperity: Achieving innovation-driven, coordinated and shared development ”, Outcome 2 reads, “ People ’s lives in China are improved further as headways is made in ensuring access to childcare, education, healthcare services, elderly care, housing, and social assistance, and more people in China, including left-behind groups, benefit from equitable and high quality public services and social protection systems as well as accelerated efforts to reduced gender inequality and other forms of social inequality throughout the life-course. ” \nThe UN makes an effort to engage persons with disabilities and their representative organizations closely across ongoing programs at country level. One attempt was to make the UN premises more accessible. An assessment on the accessibility of the physical environment and services of all UN premises in China has been completed with support of the Accessibility Development Institute of Tsinghua University in 2021, with detailed recommendations provided for improvement. \nUNTGD provides a platform for international development partners to engage with OPDs. Currently, a few bilateral and multilateral donors such as the European Commission and British Council still have programs on disability. However, consultations show that international cooperation is increasingly scrutinized by authorities, and OPDs and local stakeholders are cautious about such engagement. \n1.6 Other Key Stakeholders (Academic, Private sector): Academic institutions or think tanks play an important role in the sector, due to their access to policy making channels. However, not all academics are aligned with the CRPD. OPDs are concerned that some academic institutions regard disability as an object of research but do not meaningfully engage OPDs, displacing rather than amplifying the voices of persons with disabilities. \nPrivate sector is increasingly active in disability inclusion, due to shifting funding structure for OPDs/CSOs, domestic policy incentives for disability-inclusive employment and services, and global corporate cultural change towards Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), and corporate social responsibility (CSR). A few social enterprises have been active in engaging the private sector. However, balancing the interests of business clients and the disability community is a challenge, which needs to involve different stakeholders, including government, disability advocates, and businesses themselves. A missed opportunity identified by informants is the lack of engagement with OPDs, reinforcing the fragmentation of limited resources of the field. Further, most businesses still lack the awareness of the social model of disability, taking a charity-based or tokenistic approach.",
            "7. To establish meaningful mechanisms to enhance OPD participation and amplify the voices of persons with disabilities in UN supported programmes. For instance, within the UNPRPD program, pilot test a mechanism for OPDs to partner with scholars/CSOs/think tanks/associations on evidence-based policy advocacy. The latter stakeholders can function as intermediaries between grassroots OPDs and policy makers. The collaboration mechanism should combine OPDs ’ disability-specific expertise, with the allies ’ domain-specific expertise and government access (e.g. education, health/SRHR, employment, or accessibility), and produce joint products for policy advocacy (e.g. reports, policy proposals, internal briefings, or pilot programs). The mechanism should fully leverage OPDs ’ leadership and expertise in analyzing community needs, while strengthening OPDs ’ policy advocacy skills and local-level support networks. It should also serve to increase the disability inclusion awareness and capabilities of domain experts. OPDs shall play a leading role in the mechanism, with sufficient decision-making power at each stage of the project, rather than mere data collectors. The UN should aim for creating opportunities for de-bureaucratized, informal engagement among stakeholders. \n8. To strengthen the resources and capacity for grassroots OPDs to participate in policy making, implementation, and monitoring in UN funded programmes. This could serve as models of good practice for other local programmes. Leverage the UNPRPD program and platforms such as the UNTGD, to facilitate regular knowledge exchanges among OPDs and stakeholders on successful engagement with existing participation mechanisms. These can include best practices of partnering with governmenttrusted think tanks for policy advocacy, submitting proposals to the NPC and CPPCC sessions, engagement strategies with government entities, campaigns for mobilizing public comments on draft legislations, monitoring the implementation of accessibility standards, participation in UN human rights treaty mechanisms, and effective collaboration with the private sector. The UN should provide a safe space and allocate sufficient resources to ensure OPDs and individuals with disabilities with less access can benefit. \n9. To create platforms for capacity building and international exchange for grassroots OPDs. Although development funding is negligible compared to the scale of government budget on disability, resources for OPDs remain scarce. OPDs operating in similar social and economic contexts can share ideas and build peer-support networks. It can also increase the visibility of Chinese OPDs at the international level and share Chinese best practices with other countries. \n10. To prioritize women with disabilities and marginalized communities in the design of the PRPD program. Prioritize the leadership of women with disabilities in development programs, and support gender-sensitive approaches to disability programs, rather than merely including female participants in activities. Allocate sufficient financial and human resources to support the meaningful participation of marginalized communities, such as travel, lodging, personal assistance, and reasonable accommodations. \n11. To enhance disability and gender mutual mainstreaming within the UN system. The 2022 Disability Inclusion Scorecard Assessment shows that the UNCT still fall short in meeting Indicator 8 “ Joint programmes: Joint programmes contribute to disability inclusion ” and Indicator 9 “ Data: Strengthening data on persons with disabilities. ” OPDs expect the UN to further implement the United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy, and model best practices such as incorporating disability components, indicators, and OPDs in non-disability focused UN programs, employing persons with disabilities, enhancing the accessibility of UN offices and meetings, and increasing the collection and disclosure of data disaggregated by types of disability, degrees of disability, and location of persons with disabilities. \nwww.UNPRPD.org",

            "1.7 Key Stakeholder Coordination Mechanisms \nIn China, most OPDs are unregistered, virtual groups rather than registered organizations with a physical presence, reachable through informal networks of key individuals within disability community. Administratively, the threshold for registration as a social organization with the Ministry of Civil Affairs is high. According to a 2015 survey of 110 OPDs in China, only 58% of OPDs are legally registered with bureaus of civil affairs. 29 OPD informants point out that registered OPDs also face strict administrative requirements. Financially, many OPDs ’ funding sources were impacted by the Law on Administration of Activities of Overseas Nongovernmental Organisations, adopted in 2016, which significantly restricted domestic NGOs and individuals from obtaining funding from overseas NGOs. 30 Main funding sources available now are the government, the general public, and the private sector. These funders tend to prefer more traditional approaches to disability such as the charity or medical model, thus disadvantaging OPDs promoting the social model of disability. OPDs consulted for this report, mostly grassroots, lack experience working with INGOs, the UN, or academic partners. Key OPD informants observe that compared to other civil society groups, OPDs in China tend to rely on individual leaders and face more challenges in professional development, due to systemic exclusion of persons with disabilities in social participation, such as quality education. \nWithin China ’s national development frameworks and human rights monitoring and reporting, disability is represented as a special issue, rather than mainstreamed as a cross-cutting issue across sectors. China ’s national human rights monitoring and reporting such as human rights white papers refer to disability as one thematic issue among “ vulnerable groups ” such as women, children, ethnic minority, and elderly people. Consultation shows that the CDPF and its local networks dominate the current coordination mechanism to facilitate disability-related actions across different sectors and levels of the government. \n1.8 Stakeholder Capacity Gaps \nWithin the government, the current coordination mechanism guarantees financial and human resources on disability across different levels of the government through the CDPF networks. This bureaucratic division of labor, however, tend to pigeon-hole disability as CDPF ’s responsibility and lacks the support from mainstream ministries. Expert informants point out that as a “ semi-governmental, semi-civil ” organization, CDPF does not have the same administrative power as the ministries, making certain coordination with other ministries difficult. \nCoordination mechanisms between government and OPDs are inconsistent. Formal mechanisms for stateendorsed CSOs/OPDs to coordinate with the government do exist, such as the Disabled People ’s Representative Congress. For independent OPDs, however, coordination with the government is limited. OPDs that have successfully engaged the government tend to leverage informal channels such as joint programs with DPFs or the special associations, working with key individuals within the government, or submitting policy proposals through elected National People ’s Congress (NPC) and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) representatives. Nevertheless, most OPDs lack access to these mechanisms. In the limited scope of consultations for this report, informants note that formal mechanisms of OPDs participation tend to be symbolic, and the power imbalance makes meaningful dialogue difficult. Meanwhile, results of informal mechanisms are highly contingent. For more detail, see Section 7.1.",
            "6.2 National accountability mechanisms \nOfficially, the State Council Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work is responsible for promoting the implementation of the CRPD. Information on the effectiveness of the Committee in mainstreaming CRPD across all sectors and levels of government is lacking. 160 There is no independent mechanism appointed to monitor the implementation of the CRPD. 161 \nThe CDPF is the focal point overseeing the implementation of the CRPD, responsible for monitoring whether the creation and implementation of policies and plans relating to the rights of persons with disabilities are consistent with the CRPD principles. Some CSOs were invited to consultations for CRPD reporting but OPDs were underrepresented. 162 Most CSOs involved were specialized associations funded by the CDPF, or service provision organizations led by people without disabilities. In 2018, the State Council Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work published China ’s draft CRPD country report for public opinions, but the time window was fewer than 24 hours, making it impractical for meaningful comments to be incorporated. 163 A few OPDs have engaged in CRPD monitoring through shadow reporting, but most OPDs consulted have not engaged in CRPD monitoring mechanisms. \nChina has completed its combined second and third periodic reports. The review sessions concluded in September 2022. Major findings of the concluding observations suggest that China ’s disability-related policies and laws are not yet fully aligned with the social model of disability, OPDs independent from the state lack meaningful participation in policy-making, and China ’s legal system lacks anti-discrimination frameworks and effective provisions guaranteeing reasonable accommodations. 164 \nIn China ’s National Plan on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 165 disability was explicitly mentioned in China ’s action plan for goal 4 (quality education), 8 (decent work and economic growth), and 10 (reduced inequalities). In China ’s Progress Report on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2021), persons with disabilities were reported as beneficiaries of China ’s progress on SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG4 (quality education), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). 166 Concrete achievements include: \n• “ To ensure the right to education for people with disabilities, the second phase of the Special Educational Enhancement Program was fully completed from 2017 to 2020. By the end of 2020, the enrollment rate of children with disabilities in compulsory education exceeded 95%; a total of 880,800 special education students had been enrolled, 388,800 more than in 2016. ” \n• “ From 2016 to 2020, 1.81 million people with disabilities got employed in urban and rural areas. As of the end of 2020, 2.39 million people with disabilities obtained flexible employment (including community and home employment). ” 167 \nIn China ’s 2021 Voluntary National Review, people with disabilities are mentioned as beneficiaries of China ’s efforts in SDG 1.5, the world ’s largest social security system, and COVID response. No specific evidence was provided regarding the implementation of the disability-related goals listed in China ’s Action Plan. 168",
            "China has regularly updated its national strategy for disability since 1991, in the form of five-year development plans. By far, the State Council has issued eight five-year development plans for persons with disabilities, incorporated into the overall five-year plans for national economic and social development. Government at local levels shall make corresponding implementation plans and incorporate the implementation into government work evaluation. Annual monitoring, mid-term evaluation, concluding evaluation, third-party evaluation, and social satisfaction rate survey of the implementation of the five-year plans, are also stipulated. 41 The latest plan, the 14 th Five-year Plan on the Protection and Development of Persons with Disabilities (2021-2025), focuses on livelihood and employment, social protection, and basic public services. It sets the framework and indicators for implementation, although it is not specifically aligned with the CRPD or SDG plans and programs. \nA key legal harmonization effort, according to UN ESCAP, is “ the revision by China in 2008 of its 1990 law on the protection of persons with disabilities in an effort to incorporate the concepts and principles of the Convention into the legislation. This included a prohibition of disability discrimination, although it did not include definitions of disability or reasonable accommodation championed by the CRPD and did not explicitly state that denial of reasonable accommodation is disability discrimination. Subsequent ongoing reform efforts in China have since led to revision of the laws and regulations relating to education, transport, accessibility to the built environment and the mental health law in an effort to align them with the Convention. ” 42",

            "Findings \n1. Stakeholder and coordination analysis \n1.1 Government \nLead ministries in ensuring the rights of persons with disabilities include the Ministry of Civil Affairs, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and the National Health Commission, which, together with the China Disabled Persons ’ Federation, form the core of the State Council Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work. Other important government stakeholders include National Bureau of Statistics, the Supreme People ’s Court, and the Supreme People ’s Procuratorate. As with SDGs, in 2016, China established an inter-ministerial coordination mechanism involving 45 government departments for SDG implementation, assigning the 17 goals and 169 targets to different departments according to their administrative responsibilities. 10 \nThe China Disabled Persons ’ Federation (CDPF) functions as the de facto whole-of-government disability focal point. It is a semi-governmental umbrella mass organization funded by the Chinese government to represent, serve, and supervise disability related affairs. Established in 1988, it now has a nationwide network of local branches across China, with about 90,000 full-time workers and 400,000 part-time staff members. 11 By 2018, a total of 42,000 disabled persons ’ federations (DPFs) had been set up across the nation. 12 \nThe Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work at all levels consist of ministry-specific disability focal points within government. At the State Council level, it is formed by focal points from 34 ministries, departments and organizations to coordinate the formulation and implementation of policies and programs in relation to persons with disabilities and address major disability-related issues. 13 The Committee is also responsible for coordinating major United Nations activities regarding disability affairs in China, including promoting the implementation of the CRPD. 14 The Committee ’s Secretariat is held by the CDPF ’s General Office. 15 At the local levels, the working committees mirror the same structure, usually chaired by the deputy head of the same level government, with focal points from various departments. 16 \nOfficial Associations: Under the supervision of the CDPF, there are five specialized national associations representing the interests of people with various types of disabilities: the China Association of the Blind, the China Association of the Deaf, the China Association of Persons with Physical Disabilities, the China Association of Persons with Intellectual Disability and their Relatives, the China Association of Persons with Psychiatric Disability and their Relatives. The five associations and its local branches operate as internal parts of the CDPF and its branches. 17 By 2018, there were a total of 16,000 branches of these 13 Ibid. \nassociations at provincial, municipal, and county levels. 18 In recent years, reform efforts have been made to register special associations as separate legal entities from the DPFs to enhance the professionalization of the associations. 19 Other state-affiliated mass organizations also play a role in domain-specific disability issues, such as All China Women ’s Federation, China Internet Society, and China Family Planning Association.",

        "references": [
            "2. Equality and non-discrimination \n2.1 Legislative and policy context \nChina has ratified the CRPD in 2008, without ratifying its Optional Protocol. Under Article 35 of the CRPD, China completed its first periodic report in 2012, and second and third combined in 2018. Review of the latest report concluded in September 2022. On 5 February 2022, China ratified the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled. Other international human rights treaties that China ratified include Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), Convention against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), and International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD). 31 Reporting for CEDAW and CRC typically include references to persons with disabilities. \nOfficially, China has more than 80 laws and 50 administrative regulations directly related to the interests of persons with disabilities. 32 The main legislation stipulating the rights of persons with disabilities in China is the Law on the Protection of Disabled Persons (LPPD), first enacted in 1990 and amended in 2008 in anticipation of the CRPD ratification. Legal experts point out that significant gaps still exist between the 2008 LPPD and the CRPD, including, but not limited to, the lack of provisions of reasonable accommodation, equal recognition before law, and full inclusion of women and children with disabilities, and the law ’s prioritization of prevention and rehabilitation of disability based on medical definitions of disability. 33 A crucial gap lies in the difference in definitions of disability between the LPPD and CRPD, leading to different approaches to addressing disability-related issues. The LPPD (2008) defines a person with disabilities as “ one who has abnormalities of loss of a certain organ or function, psychologically or physiologically, or in anatomical structure and has lost wholly or in part the ability to perform an activity in the way considered normal. ” 34 \nIn addition to the LPPD, major legislations include the 2017 Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities, the 2017 Regulations on the Education of Persons with Disabilities, the Regulations on the Employment of the Disabled, and the 2012 Regulations on the Construction of Barrier-free Environments, 35 and the 2012 Mental Health Law. China ’s first Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments solicited public comments for drafts in 2022 and 2023, and was passed on June 28, 2023, which presents a key policy window for accessibility advocacy. \nChina does not have a general anti-discrimination framework or legislation, 36 although disability related laws are “ against disability-based discrimination ” in principle. The current laws and policies do not have a clear definition of disability-based discrimination, making it difficult for judicial determination of discrimination. 37 The provision of reasonable accommodation is not yet included in all relevant laws and policies, and lacks clear guidance on implementation and effective remedies. 38 As a step forward, some local regulations began explicitly referencing reasonable accommodations. 39 Major progress was made in the national college entrance examination (gaokao) system. Since 2014, there has been policy development for students with disabilities to apply for reasonable accommodations to take gaokao. Statistics show that, in 2017, 5626 students with disabilities applied for reasonable accommodation for gaokao. Advocates call for expanding such progress to more areas such as exams for public servants, high school entrance exams, and judicial exams. 40",

        "references": [
            "China has regularly updated its national strategy for disability since 1991, in the form of five-year development plans. By far, the State Council has issued eight five-year development plans for persons with disabilities, incorporated into the overall five-year plans for national economic and social development. Government at local levels shall make corresponding implementation plans and incorporate the implementation into government work evaluation. Annual monitoring, mid-term evaluation, concluding evaluation, third-party evaluation, and social satisfaction rate survey of the implementation of the five-year plans, are also stipulated. 41 The latest plan, the 14 th Five-year Plan on the Protection and Development of Persons with Disabilities (2021-2025), focuses on livelihood and employment, social protection, and basic public services. It sets the framework and indicators for implementation, although it is not specifically aligned with the CRPD or SDG plans and programs. \nA key legal harmonization effort, according to UN ESCAP, is “ the revision by China in 2008 of its 1990 law on the protection of persons with disabilities in an effort to incorporate the concepts and principles of the Convention into the legislation. This included a prohibition of disability discrimination, although it did not include definitions of disability or reasonable accommodation championed by the CRPD and did not explicitly state that denial of reasonable accommodation is disability discrimination. Subsequent ongoing reform efforts in China have since led to revision of the laws and regulations relating to education, transport, accessibility to the built environment and the mental health law in an effort to align them with the Convention. ” 42",
            "2023 marks the 15 th year since China has ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2008. The landscape of disability inclusion in China has been undergoing deep transformation. This Situational Analysis provides an overview of the five preconditions for disability inclusion, as defined by the United Nations Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNPRPD) — equality and non-discrimination, inclusive service delivery, accessibility, CRPD compliant budgeting, and accountability and governance; and three cross-cutting issues including participation, inequalities, and gender. For each area of inquiry, the analysis follows the research questions provided by the UNPRPD, in identifying the gaps and opportunities to inform future development programs. The analysis is primarily based on secondary literature review, supplemented with consultations, carried out between March 2023 and June 2023. \nEquality and Non-Discrimination: China has more than 80 laws and 50 administrative regulations directly related to the interests of persons with disabilities, and regularly updated its national strategy for disability since 1991. Translating these commitments into better inclusion requires efforts to better align disabilityrelated policies and laws with the social model of disability, meaningfully engage OPDs independent from the state in decision making, and fully implement accessibility, reasonable accommodations, and antidiscrimination provisions. Culturally, the charity or medical model of disability remains dominant in public attitudes. \nAccessibility: China has issued more than 450 regulations, rules and normative documents on accessibility implementation and management. In recent years, campaigns are carried out to improve access to information. A further welcoming development is the new Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, passed on June 28, 2023. The effects of these policies depend on strong enforcement, sufficient remedies, and the meaningful engagement of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessibility tools and rules, with considerations of diverse needs among marginalized communities, such as deaf people/persons with hearing impairments, persons with intellectual disabilities, and persons with psychosocial disabilities. \nInclusive Service Delivery: Among 85 million officially estimated persons with disabilities, 38 million (44.7%) hold a disability certificate as of 2021. The task for service provision is daunting given the huge and diverse demands, and China has reached impressive coverage of services, especially in social protection and rehabilitation. To better align with the CRPD, the next step is to shift the focus from welfare provision to social inclusion, from special needs to inclusive services. This would require better rights awareness, accessibility, and reasonable accommodations in mainstream services, such as health, education, and employment; stronger support for caregiving instead of demanding family responsibilities; and more equitable allocation of resources for marginalized communities, such as persons with disabilities in rural areas, persons with severe or multiple disabilities, women with disabilities, and persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: According to the Ministry of Finance, in 2021, the national public budget expenditure on disability affairs was CNY 70.6 billion, roughly 0.287% of the total national general public budget expenditure. Majority of the disability budget (43.3%) was spent on living and care subsidies. Inclusive services such as inclusive education and employment, as championed by the CRPD, need stronger financial support. \nAccountability and governance: The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recommends an independent mechanism appointed to monitor the implementation of the CRPD. The CDPF regularly collects data from disability certificate holders and publishes annual updates in its key mandates, yet the data is not specifically aligned with the definition of disability or priority areas of the CRPD or SDGs. Data disaggregated by disability in mainstream statistical efforts need enhancement.",
            "• SDG 8.10: Implement the Plan for Promoting the Development of Financial Inclusion(2016-2020) to establish, by 2020, an inclusive financial services and security system to increase the accessibility of timely, affordable, and convenient financial services for the general public, especially for small and micro enterprises, farmers, urban low-incomers, poor people, people with disabilities and the elderly. By 2020, establish a modern insurance industry that is comprehensive, stable, well-functioning and credible. \n• SDG 10.3: Establish a more equitable and sustainable social protection system that better protect rights and interests of vulnerable social groups such as women, minors, and people with disabilities. \nIn China ’s Progress Report on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2021), persons with disabilities were reported as beneficiaries of China ’s progress on SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG4 (quality education), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). 190 In China ’s 2021 Voluntary National Review, people with disabilities are mentioned as beneficiaries of China ’s efforts in SDG 1.5, the world ’s largest social security system, and COVID response. No specific evidence was provided regarding the implementation of the disability-related goals listed in China ’s Action Plan. 191 There is no reference to OPD participation or capacity development support of OPDs in the Action Plan, Progress Report, or Voluntary National Review. \nThe UNSDCF (2021-2025) with China included disability-related support in “ Outcome 2: People ’s lives in China are improved further as headway is made in ensuring access to childcare, education, healthcare services, elderly care, housing, and social assistance, and more people in China, including left-behind groups, benefit from equitable and high-quality public services and social protection systems as well as accelerated efforts to reduce gender inequality and other forms of social inequality throughout the lifecourse. ” 192 The UNTGD is fully consulted in the country plans and strategies, processes and reporting. Other bilateral agencies and donors promote and engage in disability rights through their participation in the UNTGD meetings and activities, but most from disability-specific rather than disability mainstreaming perspectives.",
            "Higher education \nHigher education remains largely inaccessible to persons with disabilities. As of 2019, a total of 43,900 persons with disabilities were enrolled in regular college in the entire country, 123 which means roughly 10,000 persons with disabilities graduate from college every year. By contrast, the number of college graduates without disabilities in 2020 was 8.74 million, 124 over 800 times more than persons with disabilities. Barriers faced by persons with disabilities prior to higher education include low primary school enrolment rate among persons with disabilities in rural areas, high dropout rate among children with disabilities, low educational expectation for persons with disabilities due to deeply entrenched stigma, inadequate support in school including reasonable accommodations, and limited options in colleges and majors open to persons with disabilities. 125 Due to continued advocacy, in 2014, a national policy began to allow the application for reasonable accommodations in the national college entrance exam (gaokao), and in 2017, rules on supporting students with disabilities taking regular gaokao were issued. 126 As a result, more students with disabilities were able to attend the exam, but the acceptance rate remains disproportionately low. \nEmployment and livelihood \nThe right to equal employment opportunities is stipulated in China ’s Constitution, the Labor Law, the LPPD, and Regulations on the Employment of Disabled Persons (2007). The Employment Promotion Law (2007) also contains an anti-discrimination provision regarding people with disabilities. 127 As a priority area of China ’s state disability programs, employment is typically included in the national five-year plans for disability. The latest 14 th Five-Year Plan sets goals for diversifying the types and improving the quality of employment of persons with disabilities. In 2022, the State Council adopted the Three-Year Action Plan on Promoting Disability Employment (2022-2024), setting the target of generating one million new jobs for persons with disabilities over three years, creating an important policy momentum. \nAs a form of affirmative action, China has adopted an employment quota scheme, one of the most important policy devices for promoting employment of persons with disabilities. Implemented in the late 1980s, this nationwide, legally binding scheme applies to all public and private sector organizations with a workforce exceeding 30 employees and operating for more than 3 years. It stipulates that at least 1.5% of all public or private entities ’ workforce must be persons with a disability, and non-compliance shall result in financial penalty paid to the Disabled Employment Security Fund (DESF), managed by the CDPF. 128 In practice, the quota policy has been poorly enforced, and even created perverse incentives such as “ fake employment ” practices that rent a disabled person ’s certificate as a token of compliance without real work opportunity. 129 Some OPDs point out that the policy may have caused more disability-based discrimination. 130 Consultations further show the complexity of the issue. Many persons with disabilities, due to systemic education and employment exclusion, end up depending on the income from renting their certificates to private companies. The funding scheme also contains a conflict of interest, as some local governments rely on DESF as a source of revenue, incentivizing officials to collect more fines than promoting real employment. 131",
            "Health \nGeneral healthcare \nChina ’s mainstream health policies and strategies predominantly regards disability as a target for prevention and clinical rehabilitation. The Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities (2017), the 14 th Five-year Plan on disability, 97 and the National Disability Prevention Action Plan (2021-2025), 98 all define preventing disability as specific health targets. The Healthy China 2030 Plan re-emphasizes the rehabilitation and prevention of disabilities, with a provision on “ enhancing the accessibility of medical institutions, and improving medical services for people with disabilities. ” 99 Some hospitals do provide accessible volunteer services, especially for persons with hearing or visual impairments. Consultations for this report reveal that mainstream medical system remain largely inaccessible, or unaffordable for certain communities of persons with rare diseases, and adopts a strong medical model of disability that fails to connect the patients ’ medical needs with social services. \nAccess to general healthcare is uneven. A recent analysis based on data from the National Survey on Basic Public Service Delivery of Persons with Disabilities revealed high rate of unmet healthcare needs. 15.4% of persons with disabilities lacked regular medical care when ill, and 45.6% reported needing more targeted rehabilitation services than they had. Rural residents were 13-40% more likely to lack healthcare, which was in part the result of the unequal access to health facilities, social participation, and health professionals at the community level. Among the respondents, persons with multiple disabilities experienced the highest levels of overall unmet healthcare needs, and people with physical disabilities had more unmet needs in rehabilitation. 100 Further, among China ’s over five million children with disabilities, 63% did not receive adequate healthcare, due to poor information, shortage of services, and affordability. 101 General health data disaggregated by disability, such as evidence of inequalities in health faced by persons with disabilities (corresponds to the OHCHR CRPD-SDG indicators) are not available. \nSexual and Reproductive Health and Rights Women with disabilities face additional barriers in accessing healthcare, especially sexual and reproductive health (SRH). 102 Women and youth with disabilities face higher risks of sexual violence, forced abortion, contraception and sterilization, financial and other forms of control, 103 yet they have limited access to SRH information and services. 104 In a UNESCO China and Humanity & Inclusion study, less than 20% young persons with disabilities in both urban and rural areas reported having counselling, referral services, or free contraceptives in their schools or communities. 105 A study co-funded by the CDPF \n105 Ibid. \nand State Council Committee on Women and Children ’s Work revealed large gaps in disabled women ’s access to healthcare and rehabilitation services. For instance, in Heilongjiang province, merely 50.2% women with disabilities received prenatal check during their last childbirth, 20.4 percentage points lower than women in general. Women with disabilities in rural areas had an even lower prenatal checking rate of 36.2%, and were significantly less likely (46.7 percentage points less) than urban women with disabilities to receive in-hospital child delivery care, indicating sharp disparity between urban and rural service provision. 106 Women with disabilities in poor households also experience higher prevalence of SRH related diseases. 107 An 2015 study tested the SRH knowledge of 248 women with disabilities, and the correction rate was 45.14%. 108 In response, UNESCO, UNFPA, Marie Stopes International, and Youren Foundation have conducted comprehensive sexuality education for persons with disabilities.",

        "references": [
            "By 2017, China has issued 451 regulations, rules and normative documents on accessibility implementation and management. 44 The main regulation on accessibility is the Regulations on the Construction of Barrier-free Environments (2012), which stipulate that the construction and modification of roads, public buildings, public transport facilities, residential buildings and residential areas shall comply with the construction standards for barrier-free facilities. China also incorporated barrier-free construction into its national development plans, such as the Implementation Programme for Construction of Barrier-Free Environments during the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (2016 –2020), and the National Plan on New Urbanization (2014 –2020). National accessibility standards (GB 50763-2012) have also been adopted. Comprehensive data about the application of the technical standards are unavailable and should be addressed by future research. Accessibility is not yet mainstreamed into public procurement, according to government informants consulted. \nIn recent years, more attention has been paid to the accessibility of information and communications. In 2020, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and CDPF issued the Guiding Opinions on Promoting Information Accessibility, focusing on removing barriers of the affordability, devices, and services of information for persons with disabilities. 45 On 5 February 2022, China ratified the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled. In 2021, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology launched a whole year Action Plan to modify the accessibility of internet applications for elderly people and persons with disabilities, mitigating “ digital divides. ” 46 The Action Plan explicitly listed 158 websites and applications targeted for modification, ranging from those of governments, news outlets, airlines and railways, social media, and e-commerce, to search engines, banks, travel agencies, health services. By 2022, over 800 government entities modified their web accessibility, 320 websites passed an accessibility audit, and nearly 100 applications added accessibility features such as large fonts, high contrast, and easy to read pages. 47 The provision of accessible services such as sign language interpretation are mentioned in the Rule on the Construction of Accessible Environment, Guiding Opinions on Strengthening the Construction of Broadcasting and Television Public Service System, and National Basic Public Service Standards. China has also issued its Second National Sign Language and Braille Standardization Action Plan (2021-2025), and the Promotion Plan for National Universal Sign Language. \nIn 2022, the draft Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments solicited public opinions. The second draft was released for public comments in April 2023. The legislation is widely recognized as a catalytic opportunity for raising the awareness of accessibility, and specifying the implementation measures at the local level. Expert informants involved in the legislative process praised the draft law for emphasizing accessibility at the planning stage, and legally recognizing the universal benefits of accessibility. Controversies remain about how strict the enforcement will be. OPDs are concerned about the lack of clarity on accountability and remedies, 48 the insufficient attention to the needs of persons with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities, 49 and the significant room for discretion for duty-bearers to not comply with the law, 50 making it a symbolic law with “ no teeth. ”",

The CDPF regularly collects data from disability certificate holders and publishes annual updates in its key mandates, yet the data is not specifically aligned with the definition of disability or priority areas of the CRPD or SDGs. Data disaggregated by disability in mainstream statistical efforts need enhancement.",
            "2. Equality and non-discrimination \n2.1 Legislative and policy context \nChina has ratified the CRPD in 2008, without ratifying its Optional Protocol. Under Article 35 of the CRPD, China completed its first periodic report in 2012, and second and third combined in 2018. Review of the latest report concluded in September 2022. On 5 February 2022, China ratified the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled. Other international human rights treaties that China ratified include Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), Convention against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), and International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD). 31 Reporting for CEDAW and CRC typically include references to persons with disabilities. \nOfficially, China has more than 80 laws and 50 administrative regulations directly related to the interests of persons with disabilities. 32 The main legislation stipulating the rights of persons with disabilities in China is the Law on the Protection of Disabled Persons (LPPD), first enacted in 1990 and amended in 2008 in anticipation of the CRPD ratification. Legal experts point out that significant gaps still exist between the 2008 LPPD and the CRPD, including, but not limited to, the lack of provisions of reasonable accommodation, equal recognition before law, and full inclusion of women and children with disabilities, and the law ’s prioritization of prevention and rehabilitation of disability based on medical definitions of disability. 33 A crucial gap lies in the difference in definitions of disability between the LPPD and CRPD, leading to different approaches to addressing disability-related issues. The LPPD (2008) defines a person with disabilities as “ one who has abnormalities of loss of a certain organ or function, psychologically or physiologically, or in anatomical structure and has lost wholly or in part the ability to perform an activity in the way considered normal. ” 34 \nIn addition to the LPPD, major legislations include the 2017 Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities, the 2017 Regulations on the Education of Persons with Disabilities, the Regulations on the Employment of the Disabled, and the 2012 Regulations on the Construction of Barrier-free Environments, 35 and the 2012 Mental Health Law. China ’s first Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments solicited public comments for drafts in 2022 and 2023, and was passed on June 28, 2023, which presents a key policy window for accessibility advocacy. \nChina does not have a general anti-discrimination framework or legislation, 36 although disability related laws are “ against disability-based discrimination ” in principle. The current laws and policies do not have a clear definition of disability-based discrimination, making it difficult for judicial determination of discrimination. 37 The provision of reasonable accommodation is not yet included in all relevant laws and policies, and lacks clear guidance on implementation and effective remedies. 38 As a step forward, some local regulations began explicitly referencing reasonable accommodations. 39 Major progress was made in the national college entrance examination (gaokao) system. Since 2014, there has been policy development for students with disabilities to apply for reasonable accommodations to take gaokao. Statistics show that, in 2017, 5626 students with disabilities applied for reasonable accommodation for gaokao. Advocates call for expanding such progress to more areas such as exams for public servants, high school entrance exams, and judicial exams. 40",

            "By 2017, China has issued 451 regulations, rules and normative documents on accessibility implementation and management. 44 The main regulation on accessibility is the Regulations on the Construction of Barrier-free Environments (2012), which stipulate that the construction and modification of roads, public buildings, public transport facilities, residential buildings and residential areas shall comply with the construction standards for barrier-free facilities. China also incorporated barrier-free construction into its national development plans, such as the Implementation Programme for Construction of Barrier-Free Environments during the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (2016 –2020), and the National Plan on New Urbanization (2014 –2020). National accessibility standards (GB 50763-2012) have also been adopted. Comprehensive data about the application of the technical standards are unavailable and should be addressed by future research. Accessibility is not yet mainstreamed into public procurement, according to government informants consulted. \nIn recent years, more attention has been paid to the accessibility of information and communications. In 2020, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and CDPF issued the Guiding Opinions on Promoting Information Accessibility, focusing on removing barriers of the affordability, devices, and services of information for persons with disabilities. 45 On 5 February 2022, China ratified the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled. In 2021, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology launched a whole year Action Plan to modify the accessibility of internet applications for elderly people and persons with disabilities, mitigating “ digital divides. ” 46 The Action Plan explicitly listed 158 websites and applications targeted for modification, ranging from those of governments, news outlets, airlines and railways, social media, and e-commerce, to search engines, banks, travel agencies, health services. By 2022, over 800 government entities modified their web accessibility, 320 websites passed an accessibility audit, and nearly 100 applications added accessibility features such as large fonts, high contrast, and easy to read pages. 47 The provision of accessible services such as sign language interpretation are mentioned in the Rule on the Construction of Accessible Environment, Guiding Opinions on Strengthening the Construction of Broadcasting and Television Public Service System, and National Basic Public Service Standards. China has also issued its Second National Sign Language and Braille Standardization Action Plan (2021-2025), and the Promotion Plan for National Universal Sign Language. \nIn 2022, the draft Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments solicited public opinions. The second draft was released for public comments in April 2023. The legislation is widely recognized as a catalytic opportunity for raising the awareness of accessibility, and specifying the implementation measures at the local level. Expert informants involved in the legislative process praised the draft law for emphasizing accessibility at the planning stage, and legally recognizing the universal benefits of accessibility. Controversies remain about how strict the enforcement will be. OPDs are concerned about the lack of clarity on accountability and remedies, 48 the insufficient attention to the needs of persons with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities, 49 and the significant room for discretion for duty-bearers to not comply with the law, 50 making it a symbolic law with “ no teeth. ”",
            "China ’s ageing population has made the provision of accessible environment and services ever more urgent. COVID-19 also heightened the issue of digital divide in China, making it pressing for improving the digital accessibility and digital literacy among persons with disabilities and elderly people. The new Law on the Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, passed on June 28, 2023, is indicative of the growing importance of accessibility in recent years, and creates a policy window for more awareness-raising on accessibility, including built environment, information and communication, and services. Although the second draft of the law is still criticized for having “ no teeth ” or remedies, its symbolic presence can boost the legitimacy of local OPDs ’ existing efforts in requesting access with public service providers (e.g. subway, banks, etc.). Government stakeholders also foresee needs for technical and publicity support on promoting the new legislation and specifying local-level enforcement measures. In addition, policies like the 2021 Special Action Plan on Elderly-oriented and Barrier-free Modifications for Internet Applications, the 2021 Action Plan on Improving National Digital Literacy and Skills, and China ’s entry into the Marrakesh Treaty, create incentives for more stakeholders to engage in accessibility. To take advantage of these developments, OPDs call for attention to the digital literacy divide caused by lack of access to digital tools or skills. \nChina ’s population policies have been undergoing transformations in recent years. Since 2021, couples in China are allowed to have three children with support measures. 206 In 2022, China witnessed its first population decline in 60 years. 207 While family planning policies continue to relax and policy incentives for child-rearing increase, the implications for persons with disabilities are unclear. On one hand, persons with disabilities lack equal access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) care; on the other hand, preventing disability remains a health target in national health strategies. 208 To maximize the benefits and minimize the harm of the increased investment in population growth and health management, the SRH needs of persons with disabilities warrant attention. Meanwhile, SRH offers an entry-point for persons with disabilities to address cross-cutting issues such as gender-based violence, education and health inequity, and the agency and autonomy of individuals with disabilities. \nA potential mechanism to expand OPD participation in decision-making is to take part in research that can serve as evidence for policy making. This is in line with the Communist Party ’s recent promotion for research and survey among Party members to better connect policy and practice. 209 Best practices include OPDs organizing community focus groups and partnering with scholars involved in policy making to submit proposals or policy opinions; combining short-term trainings with long-term regular research groups; and co-authoring independent surveys/study reports with subject matter experts. \nA gradual cultural shift is taking place from the medical model to the social model. More self-advocates with disabilities and new narratives are emerging in mainstream and social media, challenging stereotypes about disability. These circumstances present a crucial opportunity for the UN to leverage its influence, such as advocating for policy changes that align with the CRPD, building capacity and providing platforms for OPDs and individual advocates, and support the government, including CDPF and other ministries, in promoting inclusive services.",
            "7. Cross cutting issues \n7.1 Participation \nWithin the government system, there exist formal mechanisms to facilitate OPD participation in policymaking and decision-making. For instance, the Disabled People ’s Representative Congress, which is meant to function as the disabled persons ’ equivalent of the National People ’s Congress, represents the highest power overseeing the CDPF and is required to reserve at least half of its seats to persons with disabilities and their families/friends. 171 The five specialized associations, predominantly functioning as internal parts of the DPFs, are dedicated to serving the interests of people with the kinds of disabilities they represent, and are usually headed by people with the same kinds of disabilities or their families/friends. The CDPF also encourages more persons with disabilities and their families/friends to become NPC and CPPCC delegates. \n167 Ibid. \nOPDs independent from the government are involved in policy-making and decision-making to a much less extent, as consultations show. Most laws and regulations concerning disability pass without the formal input of non-state affiliated OPDs. An exception is the recent draft Law on Construction of BarrierFree Environments. The draft law was open for public comments in 2022 and 2023, and multiple OPDs organized public consultations and submitted comments. Results of their advocacy remain to be seen. Despite the lack of formal engagement, some independent OPDs have leveraged informal channels through key decision-makers, academics, NPC and CPPCC delegates to influence policy and law making. For instance, informants note that the inclusion of accessibility provisions in the Legal Aid Law was achieved through OPD collaboration with academic think tanks. \nConsultations show that formal mechanisms for participation tend to be highly selective, and exclusively accessed by CSOs, OPDs, or individuals with disabilities that are affiliated with or endorsed by the government, who take a rather service-oriented than rights-based approach. Most formal mechanisms are symbolic. As informants comment, meaningful dialogues are difficult due to power imbalances, and a lack of recognition of OPDs ’ leadership in disability inclusion. Meanwhile, the effect of informal mechanisms is not guaranteed, and depends highly on personal circumstances and political opportunities. Most grassroots OPDs, in reality, lack access to such mechanisms. Comprehensive assessment of different approaches for OPDs to influence decision making is not available, and is worthy of future research. \nAccording to various stakeholders, key areas of improvement for OPDs to make engagement with duty bearers include: better knowledge of existing policies; more access to official channels; stronger coordination between OPDs and policy makers/advocates (such as think thanks, scholars, and NPC/CPPCC representatives); higher awareness of the expertise and capacity of OPDs; and mechanisms that prioritizes the voices of independent OPDs.",
            "2023 marks the 15 th year since China has ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2008. The landscape of disability inclusion in China has been undergoing deep transformation. This Situational Analysis provides an overview of the five preconditions for disability inclusion, as defined by the United Nations Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNPRPD) — equality and non-discrimination, inclusive service delivery, accessibility, CRPD compliant budgeting, and accountability and governance; and three cross-cutting issues including participation, inequalities, and gender. For each area of inquiry, the analysis follows the research questions provided by the UNPRPD, in identifying the gaps and opportunities to inform future development programs. The analysis is primarily based on secondary literature review, supplemented with consultations, carried out between March 2023 and June 2023. \nEquality and Non-Discrimination: China has more than 80 laws and 50 administrative regulations directly related to the interests of persons with disabilities, and regularly updated its national strategy for disability since 1991. Translating these commitments into better inclusion requires efforts to better align disabilityrelated policies and laws with the social model of disability, meaningfully engage OPDs independent from the state in decision making, and fully implement accessibility, reasonable accommodations, and antidiscrimination provisions. Culturally, the charity or medical model of disability remains dominant in public attitudes. \nAccessibility: China has issued more than 450 regulations, rules and normative documents on accessibility implementation and management. In recent years, campaigns are carried out to improve access to information. A further welcoming development is the new Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, passed on June 28, 2023. The effects of these policies depend on strong enforcement, sufficient remedies, and the meaningful engagement of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessibility tools and rules, with considerations of diverse needs among marginalized communities, such as deaf people/persons with hearing impairments, persons with intellectual disabilities, and persons with psychosocial disabilities. \nInclusive Service Delivery: Among 85 million officially estimated persons with disabilities, 38 million (44.7%) hold a disability certificate as of 2021. The task for service provision is daunting given the huge and diverse demands, and China has reached impressive coverage of services, especially in social protection and rehabilitation. To better align with the CRPD, the next step is to shift the focus from welfare provision to social inclusion, from special needs to inclusive services. This would require better rights awareness, accessibility, and reasonable accommodations in mainstream services, such as health, education, and employment; stronger support for caregiving instead of demanding family responsibilities; and more equitable allocation of resources for marginalized communities, such as persons with disabilities in rural areas, persons with severe or multiple disabilities, women with disabilities, and persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: According to the Ministry of Finance, in 2021, the national public budget expenditure on disability affairs was CNY 70.6 billion, roughly 0.287% of the total national general public budget expenditure. Majority of the disability budget (43.3%) was spent on living and care subsidies. Inclusive services such as inclusive education and employment, as championed by the CRPD, need stronger financial support. \nAccountability and governance: The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recommends an independent mechanism appointed to monitor the implementation of the CRPD. The CDPF regularly collects data from disability certificate holders and publishes annual updates in its key mandates, yet the data is not specifically aligned with the definition of disability or priority areas of the CRPD or SDGs.

            "4.3 Mainstream Services \nSocial protection \nChina ’s social protection system for persons with disabilities include three main mechanisms: 1) welfare subsidies (fuli butie), such as living subsidies for disabled persons in hardships, and care subsidies for persons with severe disabilities; 2) social insurance subsidies (shehui baoxian butie), such as pension and medical insurance subsidies; and 3) special assistance (zhuanxiang jiuzhu), such as minimum living standard guarantee (dibao), and assistance for disaster, healthcare, education, and housing. 90 \nChina has reached wide coverage of social protection for persons with disabilities. For example, living allowances for poor people with disabilities and nursing subsidies for severely disabled persons now cover more than 24 million people. 10.67 million people with disabilities are included in the system of subsistence allowances. All poor persons with disabilities are covered by basic medical insurance and serious illness insurance, according to an official white paper. 91 \nBy 2021, China has declared success in lifting more than 7 million persons with disabilities out of absolute poverty. 92 Yet persons with disabilities remain economically marginalized. Experts estimate that 36% to 44% of certified persons with disabilities in China can be considered under “ relative poverty. ” 93 In 2019, over 30% of total disability certificate holders received living subsidies for disabled persons in hardships, and care subsidies for persons with severe disabilities. 94 Social protection remains an important source of income for persons with disabilities, making up 13.2% of total disabled persons ’ household income on average. 95 Households with the lowest income are most dependent on social protection, but their average income from social protection was merely CNY 2,631.30 per year, as of 2019. 96",

There is no specific quota for persons with disabilities in the People ’s Congresses or Political Consultation Parties. In 2020, DPFs assisted 735 policy recommendations by people ’s congress and political consultation party delegates, and handled 1109 cases of their recommendations. 144 In practice, the lack of reasonable accommodations in political processes, the restrictions posed by mandatory public servant medical examinations, the tokenization of government employment quota, the preference for people with less severe disabilities, discriminatory social attitudes, and inadequate access to equal education, all contribute to the low rate of political participation of persons with disabilities. 145 Among persons with disabilities working at state institutions, persons with physical disabilities, and those with less severe disabilities are preferred. As of 2018, among local DPFs, 69.3% of municipal-level DPFs and 49.8% of county-level DPFs had staff members with disabilities. 146 As a step forward, in 2021, CDPF and four other ministries and departments issued a policy guidance regarding employing persons with disabilities in state organs, public institutions, and state-owned enterprises, explicitly requiring public sector employers to reasonably define the physical exam requirements for candidates with disabilities, and must not judge the candidates ’ health on the basis of their disability. 147 \n5. CRPD-compliant budgeting and financial management \nThere are three main mechanisms for the Chinese government to fund disability-related programs: regular public budget, special subsidy, and disability employment security fund (DESF). 148 From 2013 to 2017, the fiscal allocations from all levels of the government for persons with disabilities added up to over CNY 180 billion. 149 In 2021, the national public budget expenditure on disability affairs was CNY 70.6 billion, taking up 0.287% of the total national general public budget expenditure (24567.3 billion). 150 Compared to the scale of Chinese government budget (50-70 billion CNY per year), budgets of ongoing national development and humanitarian programs funded by international development partners are negligible. \nThe expenditures on disability affairs in 2021 included 30.6 billion on living and care subsidies (43.3%), 7.2 billion on rehabilitation, 6.6 billion on employment and poverty reduction, 5.5 billion on administrative costs, and 18.8 billion categorized as other expenditures. 151 In addition, CNY 16.1 billion of national public budget was spent on special education, 0.43% of the total education expenditures (3746.9 billion). 152 Article 48 of the 2017 Regulations on the Education of Persons with Disabilities stipulates that “ the financial funds allocated for compulsory education by local people ’s governments at all levels, as well as extra charges for education collected by these governments, shall have a certain proportion set aside for compulsory education for children and adolescents with disabilities. ” 153 Yet the proportion is not specified. \n146于娣.(2020).中国特色残联组织功能研究(博士学位论文,武汉理工大学). \nMost funding allocated for educating persons with disabilities are spent on special schools, and inclusive education in regular schools lacks financial support. 154 In 2021, The Action Plan for Special Education Development (2021-2025), issued in 2022 by the MOE, intends to increase the average government expenditure on compulsory education for children with disabilities from 6,000 yuan per student now to 7,000 yuan by 2025. 155",

            "Health \nGeneral healthcare \nChina ’s mainstream health policies and strategies predominantly regards disability as a target for prevention and clinical rehabilitation. The Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities (2017), the 14 th Five-year Plan on disability, 97 and the National Disability Prevention Action Plan (2021-2025), 98 all define preventing disability as specific health targets. The Healthy China 2030 Plan re-emphasizes the rehabilitation and prevention of disabilities, with a provision on “ enhancing the accessibility of medical institutions, and improving medical services for people with disabilities. ” 99 Some hospitals do provide accessible volunteer services, especially for persons with hearing or visual impairments. Consultations for this report reveal that mainstream medical system remain largely inaccessible, or unaffordable for certain communities of persons with rare diseases, and adopts a strong medical model of disability that fails to connect the patients ’ medical needs with social services. \nAccess to general healthcare is uneven. A recent analysis based on data from the National Survey on Basic Public Service Delivery of Persons with Disabilities revealed high rate of unmet healthcare needs. 15.4% of persons with disabilities lacked regular medical care when ill, and 45.6% reported needing more targeted rehabilitation services than they had. Rural residents were 13-40% more likely to lack healthcare, which was in part the result of the unequal access to health facilities, social participation, and health professionals at the community level. Among the respondents, persons with multiple disabilities experienced the highest levels of overall unmet healthcare needs, and people with physical disabilities had more unmet needs in rehabilitation. 100 Further, among China ’s over five million children with disabilities, 63% did not receive adequate healthcare, due to poor information, shortage of services, and affordability. 101 General health data disaggregated by disability, such as evidence of inequalities in health faced by persons with disabilities (corresponds to the OHCHR CRPD-SDG indicators) are not available. \nSexual and Reproductive Health and Rights Women with disabilities face additional barriers in accessing healthcare, especially sexual and reproductive health (SRH). 102 Women and youth with disabilities face higher risks of sexual violence, forced abortion, contraception and sterilization, financial and other forms of control, 103 yet they have limited access to SRH information and services. 104 In a UNESCO China and Humanity & Inclusion study, less than 20% young persons with disabilities in both urban and rural areas reported having counselling, referral services, or free contraceptives in their schools or communities. 105 A study co-funded by the CDPF \n105 Ibid. \nand State Council Committee on Women and Children ’s Work revealed large gaps in disabled women ’s access to healthcare and rehabilitation services. For instance, in Heilongjiang province, merely 50.2% women with disabilities received prenatal check during their last childbirth, 20.4 percentage points lower than women in general. Women with disabilities in rural areas had an even lower prenatal checking rate of 36.2%, and were significantly less likely (46.7 percentage points less) than urban women with disabilities to receive in-hospital child delivery care, indicating sharp disparity between urban and rural service provision. 106 Women with disabilities in poor households also experience higher prevalence of SRH related diseases. 107 An 2015 study tested the SRH knowledge of 248 women with disabilities, and the correction rate was 45.14%. 108 In response, UNESCO, UNFPA, Marie Stopes International, and Youren Foundation have conducted comprehensive sexuality education for persons with disabilities.",
            "China ’s ageing population has made the provision of accessible environment and services ever more urgent. COVID-19 also heightened the issue of digital divide in China, making it pressing for improving the digital accessibility and digital literacy among persons with disabilities and elderly people. The new Law on the Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, passed on June 28, 2023, is indicative of the growing importance of accessibility in recent years, and creates a policy window for more awareness-raising on accessibility, including built environment, information and communication, and services. Although the second draft of the law is still criticized for having “ no teeth ” or remedies, its symbolic presence can boost the legitimacy of local OPDs ’ existing efforts in requesting access with public service providers (e.g. subway, banks, etc.). Government stakeholders also foresee needs for technical and publicity support on promoting the new legislation and specifying local-level enforcement measures. In addition, policies like the 2021 Special Action Plan on Elderly-oriented and Barrier-free Modifications for Internet Applications, the 2021 Action Plan on Improving National Digital Literacy and Skills, and China ’s entry into the Marrakesh Treaty, create incentives for more stakeholders to engage in accessibility. To take advantage of these developments, OPDs call for attention to the digital literacy divide caused by lack of access to digital tools or skills. \nChina ’s population policies have been undergoing transformations in recent years. Since 2021, couples in China are allowed to have three children with support measures. 206 In 2022, China witnessed its first population decline in 60 years. 207 While family planning policies continue to relax and policy incentives for child-rearing increase, the implications for persons with disabilities are unclear. On one hand, persons with disabilities lack equal access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) care; on the other hand, preventing disability remains a health target in national health strategies. 208 To maximize the benefits and minimize the harm of the increased investment in population growth and health management, the SRH needs of persons with disabilities warrant attention. Meanwhile, SRH offers an entry-point for persons with disabilities to address cross-cutting issues such as gender-based violence, education and health inequity, and the agency and autonomy of individuals with disabilities. \nA potential mechanism to expand OPD participation in decision-making is to take part in research that can serve as evidence for policy making. This is in line with the Communist Party ’s recent promotion for research and survey among Party members to better connect policy and practice. 209 Best practices include OPDs organizing community focus groups and partnering with scholars involved in policy making to submit proposals or policy opinions; combining short-term trainings with long-term regular research groups; and co-authoring independent surveys/study reports with subject matter experts. \nA gradual cultural shift is taking place from the medical model to the social model. More self-advocates with disabilities and new narratives are emerging in mainstream and social media, challenging stereotypes about disability. These circumstances present a crucial opportunity for the UN to leverage its influence, such as advocating for policy changes that align with the CRPD, building capacity and providing platforms for OPDs and individual advocates, and support the government, including CDPF and other ministries, in promoting inclusive services.",
            "Analysis of key gaps and opportunities \nGaps \nEquality and non-discrimination: Attitudinal barriers are considered by stakeholders as one of the most fundamental challenges that cuts across all preconditions for inclusion. Progress has been made since the adoption of CRPD in 2008 in terms of awareness-raising of the social model of disability, especially among development partners and OPDs/CSOs. Yet the Chinese society at large and its corresponding systems are predominantly taking a medical model approach to disability, regarding persons with disabilities as subjects of charity and welfare in need of special rather than mainstream services. Policy makers and service providers, especially at grassroots levels, lack the awareness and buy-in of CRPD or the social model of disability. Laws and regulations relevant to disability are not fully aligned with the CRPD, and lack strength in enforcement and remedies. \nInclusive Service Delivery: The current policy frameworks tend to regard persons with disabilities as welfare beneficiaries more than rights holders. Public provision of disability support services prioritize social protection, subsidies, and rehabilitation, less focused on building support systems for the equal participation of persons with disabilities in society, such as inclusive education and employment. Policy makers are incentivized to maximize service coverage for the large population of persons with disabilities with limited resources, de-emphasizing the quality of services. The agency and autonomy of persons with disabilities is downplayed. As reflected in multi-stakeholder consultations, OPDs are concerned about the policy focus on family ’s responsibility in caregiving for persons with disabilities, without sufficient government support. \nAccessibility: Unchecked discrimination against persons with disabilities, combined with the lack of reasonable accommodations and accessibility, pose consistent barriers in all aspects of social participation of persons with disabilities. Despite increased government investment in accessibility, weak enforcement, insufficient remedies, and the lack of meaningful participation of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessible tools and standards has resulted in the poor quality of accessibility measures. As shown in the draft Law on the Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, there is also a tendency to prioritize physical environment over access to information and service provision, especially for persons with intellectual or psychosocial impairments, and deaf people/persons with hearing impairments. \nAccountability and Governance: Disability has not yet been mainstreamed into the current governance structure. The CDPF system is assigned the responsibility for disability inclusion but with insufficient authority to coordinate with other ministries. This relatively segregated coordination mechanism within the government, according to stakeholders consulted, can form barriers for OPDs to engage mainstream ministries and obtain resources from the government which are concentrated within the DPF system. Consistent data collections on disability inclusion aligned with the CRPD and SDGs are lacking. Official statistics on disability adopt impairment-based definitions of disability and does not comply with the ICF or CRPD definitions of disability. Further, stakeholders are concerned about the reliability of self-reported data, the transparency of data, and the lack of disaggregated data by disability in mainstream data collections. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: Despite the much larger size compared to development partners, government budgeting prioritizes welfare provision over rights protection, and special rather than mainstream services. Significant power and resource imbalances exist between the duty bearers and rights holders. While development partners are reducing support for countries like China as its income level grows, development programs funded by foreign entities are under increasing legal and administrative scrutiny. This has impacted the development of independent OPDs which lack access to government resources.",
            "8.4 COVID-19 \nThe Law on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, which is the legal basis for China ’s COVID policies, is criticized for lacking a disability lens and overlooks the needs of persons with disabilities in terms of access to information, basic goods and services, medications and assistive devices, and care. 201 In 2020, the CDPF issued a Guideline on the Protection of Disabled Persons in Severe Infectious Disease Epidemics, which mainly provides generic guidance for self-protection. 202 \nIn 2021, Raoul Wallenberg Institute of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law conducted a participatory action research with the OPD Minority Voices, offering the first comprehensive study of COVID-19 experiences of persons with disabilities. According to the report, persons with disabilities have experienced disruptions of access to regular healthcare, community living, employment, and education during lockdowns. Top unmet needs include purchasing medical supplies, worsened mental health, paused access to delivery services, sense of isolation, lack of financial relief, loss of livelihood, lack of remote learning support, and inaccessibility of remote learning tools. 203 \nIn response, OPDs, volunteer groups, and individuals with disabilities have actively participated in community-level mutual assistance, and disability-inclusive advocacy. For instance, in early 2020, deaf persons ’ organization ProSigner, based in Wuhan, organized to support local deaf communities to access accurate public health information and distributing medical supplies such as masks, disinfectants, and gloves. 204 A network of volunteers from across the country organized to support people with disabilities in coordination with local CSOs, providing information, shopping, counselling, and resource referral services. Inclusion China launched a mutual assistance network among families of people with intellectual disabilities. Multiple OPDs/CSOs such as One Plus One, Able Development Institute, Voices of the Disabled, and the Disability COVID Support Volunteer Network, drafted specific handbooks and guidelines regarding the science of COVID, self-protection measures, response to domestic violence during quarantine, and accessible emergency response and service provision. Women ’s OPD BEST organized donations of sanitary care products for women with disabilities. 205 \nhttps://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/C_GmGMiqGQI3teh9QK_JtQ This section focuses on the overall key challenges in systems, structures, practices, and capacities and discusses the underlying causes. Specific gaps under each area of inquiry will not be repeated here.",
            "literature review, supplemented with consultations, carried out between March 2023 and June 2023. \nEquality and Non-Discrimination: China has more than 80 laws and 50 administrative regulations directly related to the interests of persons with disabilities, and regularly updated its national strategy for disability since 1991. Translating these commitments into better inclusion requires efforts to better align disabilityrelated policies and laws with the social model of disability, meaningfully engage OPDs independent from the state in decision making, and fully implement accessibility, reasonable accommodations, and antidiscrimination provisions. Culturally, the charity or medical model of disability remains dominant in public attitudes. \nAccessibility: China has issued more than 450 regulations, rules and normative documents on accessibility implementation and management. In recent years, campaigns are carried out to improve access to information. A further welcoming development is the new Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, passed on June 28, 2023. The effects of these policies depend on strong enforcement, sufficient remedies, and the meaningful engagement of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessibility tools and rules, with considerations of diverse needs among marginalized communities, such as deaf people/persons with hearing impairments, persons with intellectual disabilities, and persons with psychosocial disabilities. \nInclusive Service Delivery: Among 85 million officially estimated persons with disabilities, 38 million (44.7%) hold a disability certificate as of 2021. The task for service provision is daunting given the huge and diverse demands, and China has reached impressive coverage of services, especially in social protection and rehabilitation. To better align with the CRPD, the next step is to shift the focus from welfare provision to social inclusion, from special needs to inclusive services. This would require better rights awareness, accessibility, and reasonable accommodations in mainstream services, such as health, education, and employment; stronger support for caregiving instead of demanding family responsibilities; and more equitable allocation of resources for marginalized communities, such as persons with disabilities in rural areas, persons with severe or multiple disabilities, women with disabilities, and persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: According to the Ministry of Finance, in 2021, the n"

            "Education \nThe right to education for persons with disabilities is stipulated by China ’s Constitution, the LPPD, the Law on Compulsory Education, and the Regulations on the Education of Persons with Disabilities. The Ministry of Education (MOE) regulate and oversee all schools providing education for persons with disabilities, in coordination with local health departments, civil affairs departments, and the DPFs. 109 According to the MOE, the enrolment rate in compulsory education among children with disabilities has reached over 95%. 110 The Action Plan for Special Education Development (2021-2025), issued in 2022 by the MOE, planned to expand the coverage of compulsory education for children with disabilities to 97% by 2025. 111 China has taken steps towards a more inclusive education approach. In 2017, China revised the Regulations on the Education of Persons with Disabilities, 112 more firmly stating the principle of inclusive education and anti-discrimination than the 1994 version. Article 3 of the new Regulations explicitly stipulates that “ general education approach, ” namely inclusive education, should be given priority. According to the government, as of 2017, over 50% of students with disabilities receiving compulsory \neducation studied at regular schools. 113 The number of students with disabilities at regular schools has increased from 239,000 in 2015 to 439,000 in 2020. 114 \nMeanwhile, the revised Regulations, as well as policy directives such as the National Long-Term Educational Reform and Development Plan (2010 –2020), continues to encourage the expansion of special education. Namely, China takes a “ double-track approach ” that promotes both special education and inclusive education. 115 Challenges to inclusive education include China ’s typically large class size, the lack of special education expertise among teachers, limited resources, and ableist attitudes. Further, the double-track approach places emphasis on students ’ abilities to adapt to ordinary classes instead of capacity building of regular education system to attend to the diverse learning needs of learners with and without disabilities. The system also entrenches the rigid separation of expertise between regular school and special school teachers, and creates incentives for the special education system to retain students within special schools rather than supporting them in an inclusive setting. 116 \nPreschool and Compulsory education (elementary and middle school) Students with disabilities typically receive education through systems of special education, special classes in mainstream schools, learning in regular classes (sui ban jiu du), or home schooling (song jiao shang men). At the pre-school level, kindergartens lack the support system and technical skills to include children with disabilities, despite policy support such as the 14 th Special Education Development and Improvement Action Plan. 117 \nAccess to compulsory education is still uneven. In remoteand rural areas, students with disabilities receive lower levels of education, less access to special education teachers, and other support services necessary for education. 118 Students who learn in regular classes lack quality education, as regular school teachers lack special education capacity. Regular schools that do have special education resource centers tend to prioritize facilities and equipment, downplaying the role of specialized staff. For home schooling, students with multiple or severe disabilities, including people with autism and cerebral palsy, face significant barriers in obtaining quality education. 119",

            "Higher education \nHigher education remains largely inaccessible to persons with disabilities. As of 2019, a total of 43,900 persons with disabilities were enrolled in regular college in the entire country, 123 which means roughly 10,000 persons with disabilities graduate from college every year. By contrast, the number of college graduates without disabilities in 2020 was 8.74 million, 124 over 800 times more than persons with disabilities. Barriers faced by persons with disabilities prior to higher education include low primary school enrolment rate among persons with disabilities in rural areas, high dropout rate among children with disabilities, low educational expectation for persons with disabilities due to deeply entrenched stigma, inadequate support in school including reasonable accommodations, and limited options in colleges and majors open to persons with disabilities. 125 Due to continued advocacy, in 2014, a national policy began to allow the application for reasonable accommodations in the national college entrance exam (gaokao), and in 2017, rules on supporting students with disabilities taking regular gaokao were issued. 126 As a result, more students with disabilities were able to attend the exam, but the acceptance rate remains disproportionately low. \nEmployment and livelihood \nThe right to equal employment opportunities is stipulated in China ’s Constitution, the Labor Law, the LPPD, and Regulations on the Employment of Disabled Persons (2007). The Employment Promotion Law (2007) also contains an anti-discrimination provision regarding people with disabilities. 127 As a priority area of China ’s state disability programs, employment is typically included in the national five-year plans for disability. The latest 14 th Five-Year Plan sets goals for diversifying the types and improving the quality of employment of persons with disabilities. In 2022, the State Council adopted the Three-Year Action Plan on Promoting Disability Employment (2022-2024), setting the target of generating one million new jobs for persons with disabilities over three years, creating an important policy momentum. \nAs a form of affirmative action, China has adopted an employment quota scheme, one of the most important policy devices for promoting employment of persons with disabilities. Implemented in the late 1980s, this nationwide, legally binding scheme applies to all public and private sector organizations with a workforce exceeding 30 employees and operating for more than 3 years. It stipulates that at least 1.5% of all public or private entities ’ workforce must be persons with a disability, and non-compliance shall result in financial penalty paid to the Disabled Employment Security Fund (DESF), managed by the CDPF. 128 In practice, the quota policy has been poorly enforced, and even created perverse incentives such as “ fake employment ” practices that rent a disabled person ’s certificate as a token of compliance without real work opportunity. 129 Some OPDs point out that the policy may have caused more disability-based discrimination. 130 Consultations further show the complexity of the issue. Many persons with disabilities, due to systemic education and employment exclusion, end up depending on the income from renting their certificates to private companies. The funding scheme also contains a conflict of interest, as some local governments rely on DESF as a source of revenue, incentivizing officials to collect more fines than promoting real employment. 131",

In 2020, DPFs assisted 735 policy recommendations by people ’s congress and political consultation party delegates, and handled 1109 cases of their recommendations. 144 In practice, the lack of reasonable accommodations in political processes, the restrictions posed by mandatory public servant medical examinations, the tokenization of government employment quota, the preference for people with less severe disabilities, discriminatory social attitudes, and inadequate access to equal education, all contribute to the low rate of political participation of persons with disabilities. 145 Among persons with disabilities working at state institutions, persons with physical disabilities, and those with less severe disabilities are preferred. As of 2018, among local DPFs, 69.3% of municipal-level DPFs and 49.8% of county-level DPFs had staff members with disabilities. 146 As a step forward, in 2021, CDPF and four other ministries and departments issued a policy guidance regarding employing persons with disabilities in state organs, public institutions, and state-owned enterprises, explicitly requiring public sector employers to reasonably define the physical exam requirements for candidates with disabilities, and must not judge the candidates ’ health on the basis of their disability. 147 \n5. CRPD-compliant budgeting and financial management \nThere are three main mechanisms for the Chinese government to fund disability-related programs: regular public budget, special subsidy, and disability employment security fund (DESF). 148 From 2013 to 2017, the fiscal allocations from all levels of the government for persons with disabilities added up to over CNY 180 billion. 149 In 2021, the national public budget expenditure on disability affairs was CNY 70.6 billion, taking up 0.287% of the total national general public budget expenditure (24567.3 billion). 150 Compared to the scale of Chinese government budget (50-70 billion CNY per year), budgets of ongoing national development and humanitarian programs funded by international development partners are negligible. \nThe expenditures on disability affairs in 2021 included 30.6 billion on living and care subsidies (43.3%), 7.2 billion on rehabilitation, 6.6 billion on employment and poverty reduction, 5.5 billion on administrative costs, and 18.8 billion categorized as other expenditures. 151 In addition, CNY 16.1 billion of national public budget was spent on special education, 0.43% of the total education expenditures (3746.9 billion). 152 Article 48 of the 2017 Regulations on the Education of Persons with Disabilities stipulates that “ the financial funds allocated for compulsory education by local people ’s governments at all levels, as well as extra charges for education collected by these governments, shall have a certain proportion set aside for compulsory education for children and adolescents with disabilities. ” 153 Yet the proportion is not specified. \n146于娣.(2020).中国特色残联组织功能研究(博士学位论文,武汉理工大学). \nMost funding allocated for educating persons with disabilities are spent on special schools, and inclusive education in regular schools lacks financial support. 154 In 2021, The Action Plan for Special Education Development (2021-2025), issued in 2022 by the MOE, intends to increas"

            "The overall labor participation rate remains low for persons with disabilities. Although official data estimates over half of working-age people with disabilities are employed, 132 about three quarters of these jobs are categorized as either agriculture, cultivation, or “ flexible ” employment, 133 namely temporary or part-time jobs (see Figure 1). Persons with disabilities are significantly less likely to work in higher skilled white-collar occupations. 134 As key targets of poverty alleviation, as of 2018, households of persons with disabilities earned less than 60% of the national average and the gap continues to widen. 135 Among all, persons with intellectual disabilities were least accepted by employers. According to a report based on surveys of 203 families in Guangzhou, only 2% of persons with intellectual disabilities in Guangzhou had meaningful employment. 136 A recent survey of 328 companies shows that 70.4% persons with disabilities hired by these employers are people with physical impairments, and 59.8% are in supporting or administrative roles. 137 \n131 In consultation, informants have identified multiple systemic barriers to inclusive employment, including: \n• inadequate access to equal education opportunities, including the lack of high-quality basic education, as well as vocational training and skill development opportunities for persons with disabilities; \n• the lack of anti-discrimination and disability mainstreaming laws and policies; \n• lack of public sector role models for disability-inclusive employment; \n• lack of disability inclusion expertise among employment service providers; \n• discriminatory social attitudes towards persons with disabilities by families and friends, employers, co-workers, and even persons with disabilities themselves; \n• Lack of accessibility and reasonable accommodations to and at workplaces. \nILO ’s Global Business and Disability Network (GBDN) China Chapter has made progress in influencing the private sector to recruit and include persons with disabilities. While attracting local companies to join GBDN-China and promoting inclusive employment practices remains a challenge, GBDN-China presents an opportunity to generate good practices and share experiences with other companies in China.",
            "2.2 Barriers to Equity \nThe Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities observed systemic barriers to the inclusion of persons with disabilities in China, including that 43 : \n• disability-related policies and laws do not fully align with the social model of disability; \n• OPDs independent from the state are not meaningfully included in policy-making; \n• anti-discrimination and reasonable accommodations are not legally guaranteed or fully implemented; \n• there are limited mechanisms in preventing violence, trafficking, forced marriage, neglect, or abandonment of women and children with disabilities; \n• substitute decision-making regime persists to deny or restricts adults with disabilities in their legal capacity to act; \n• lack of procedural accommodation, accessible information, and inaccessible buildings impedes disabled persons ’ access to justice; \n• discriminatory provisions in the LPPD allow for coercive institutionalization and treatment of persons with psychosocial disabilities; \n• accessibility regulations and standards are insufficiently enforced; \n• the state pressures on and censors rights-based advocacy; \n• segregated special education remains the norm and mainstream schools lack support regarding inclusive education; \n• the right to freely choose occupations and access to just and favourable conditions of work is lacking; \n• and legal restrictions to disabled persons ’ political participation still persists. \nAmong these barriers, consultations for this report identified the social prejudice and discrimination against persons with disabilities as the most fundamental. Debates between the “ welfare ” approach and the “ rights ” approach to disability remain among policy and law makers. Specific barriers in domains such as accessibility, education, and employment will be addressed in detail in Section 3 and Section 4. \n3. Accessibility \n3.1 Legislative and policy context",
            "Analysis of key gaps and opportunities \nGaps \nEquality and non-discrimination: Attitudinal barriers are considered by stakeholders as one of the most fundamental challenges that cuts across all preconditions for inclusion. Progress has been made since the adoption of CRPD in 2008 in terms of awareness-raising of the social model of disability, especially among development partners and OPDs/CSOs. Yet the Chinese society at large and its corresponding systems are predominantly taking a medical model approach to disability, regarding persons with disabilities as subjects of charity and welfare in need of special rather than mainstream services. Policy makers and service providers, especially at grassroots levels, lack the awareness and buy-in of CRPD or the social model of disability. Laws and regulations relevant to disability are not fully aligned with the CRPD, and lack strength in enforcement and remedies. \nInclusive Service Delivery: The current policy frameworks tend to regard persons with disabilities as welfare beneficiaries more than rights holders. Public provision of disability support services prioritize social protection, subsidies, and rehabilitation, less focused on building support systems for the equal participation of persons with disabilities in society, such as inclusive education and employment. Policy makers are incentivized to maximize service coverage for the large population of persons with disabilities with limited resources, de-emphasizing the quality of services. The agency and autonomy of persons with disabilities is downplayed. As reflected in multi-stakeholder consultations, OPDs are concerned about the policy focus on family ’s responsibility in caregiving for persons with disabilities, without sufficient government support. \nAccessibility: Unchecked discrimination against persons with disabilities, combined with the lack of reasonable accommodations and accessibility, pose consistent barriers in all aspects of social participation of persons with disabilities. Despite increased government investment in accessibility, weak enforcement, insufficient remedies, and the lack of meaningful participation of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessible tools and standards has resulted in the poor quality of accessibility measures. As shown in the draft Law on the Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, there is also a tendency to prioritize physical environment over access to information and service provision, especially for persons with intellectual or psychosocial impairments, and deaf people/persons with hearing impairments. \nAccountability and Governance: Disability has not yet been mainstreamed into the current governance structure. The CDPF system is assigned the responsibility for disability inclusion but with insufficient authority to coordinate with other ministries. This relatively segregated coordination mechanism within the government, according to stakeholders consulted, can form barriers for OPDs to engage mainstream ministries and obtain resources from the government which are concentrated within the DPF system. Consistent data collections on disability inclusion aligned with the CRPD and SDGs are lacking. Official statistics on disability adopt impairment-based definitions of disability and does not comply with the ICF or CRPD definitions of disability. Further, stakeholders are concerned about the reliability of self-reported data, the transparency of data, and the lack of disaggregated data by disability in mainstream data collections. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: Despite the much larger size compared to development partners, government budgeting prioritizes welfare provision over rights protection, and special rather than mainstream services. Significant power and resource imbalances exist between the duty bearers and rights holders. While development partners are reducing support for countries like China as its income level grows, development programs funded by foreign entities are under increasing legal and administrative scrutiny. This has impacted the development of independent OPDs which lack access to government resources.",
            "A decade later, women with disabilities face continued barriers in care, marriage and social life, reproductive health care, and equal opportunities to employment, as shown in a women ’s OPD survey of 535 women with disabilities. 187 Another recent multi-year OPD survey of 1,083 women with disabilities reveals that as high as 33% of them were once told to discontinue their education. Among educated informants, 24% experienced dropout because of their disability. 54.3% of women studied were not employed, for whom caretaking responsibilities and unsuccessful job seeking are the main reasons. Over half of the women reported experiences of rejection for job opportunities because of their disability, and 34.4% because of their gender. Most working women, on the other hand, received no support on workplace accessibility and reasonable accommodation, and 44.7% of them did not receive equal pay for equal work. Over half of the informants reported personal income as lower than CNY 2000 per month. 36.3% of women surveyed in 2020 experienced loss of income due to COVID-19. 188 \nIn 2020, the CDPF, supported by UN ESCAP, UN Women, UNFPA, and Rehabilitation International, released a “ Call to Action: Enabling Sisters with Disabilities to Join in Shaping the Future We Want ” in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action at the Fourth World Conference on Women, and the fifth year of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Promoting adequate standard of living, health, and education of women and girls with disabilities are among the top of the list of call for actions. Sexual and reproductive health is considered a key entry point of intervention for women and LGBTI persons with disabilities by consulted stakeholders, which, in the context of China, connects cross-cutting issues of healthcare, education, employment, accessibility, anti-violence, and rights awareness raising for persons with disabilities. \n8. Disability Inclusion in Broader Development, Humanitarian & Emergency Contexts \n8.1 National Development Plans \nIn China ’s National Plan on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 189 disability was explicitly mentioned in China ’s action plan for goal 4 (quality education), 8 (decent work and economic growth), and 10 (reduced inequalities). Specifically, China ’s actions plans with explicit reference to disability include: \n• SDG 4.2: Improve the funding system for preschool education to help the less-privileged, such as children from needy families, orphans and children with disabilities, to gain access to public preschool education. Improve the quality of kindergarten teachers \n• SDG 4.5: Protect everyone ’s right including that of vulnerable groups to education, and improve special education. Open special education schools in counties with more than 300,000 residents and gradually ensure 12-year free education for children with disabilities, covering the 9-year compulsory education and the senior high school education. \n• SDG 8.5: Increase labor force participation rate through implementation of the classification policy. Vigorously enforce the Law on Promotion of Employment. Targeted measures have been formulated to promote employment of university graduates, migrant workers, people with disabilities, retired soldiers, women and some other groups. Improve employment and entrepreneurship services and launch a lifelong vocational training initiative.",
            "The situation and rights of persons with disabilities is incorporated into the Common Country Analysis, UNSDCF and Joint Work Plans in full consultation with the UNTGD. As a result, the UNSDCF 2021-2025 has integrated disability inclusion by setting the commitment to “ leaving no one behind ” as one of its guiding principles and explicitly identifying persons with disabilities as one o f the groups more at risk of being left behind in China. Persons with disability are particularly referenced in parts related to rehabilitation services, full social inclusion, development, and legitimate rights and interests. Besides, UNSDCF also specifically stipulates that the participation of CDPF in the review and implementation of the UNSDCF will be made at the level of the Results Groups. \nSpecifically, under the UNSDCF Strategic Priority 1 “ People and Prosperity: Achieving innovation-driven, coordinated and shared development ”, Outcome 2 reads, “ People ’s lives in China are improved further as headways is made in ensuring access to childcare, education, healthcare services, elderly care, housing, and social assistance, and more people in China, including left-behind groups, benefit from equitable and high quality public services and social protection systems as well as accelerated efforts to reduced gender inequality and other forms of social inequality throughout the life-course. ” \nThe UN makes an effort to engage persons with disabilities and their representative organizations closely across ongoing programs at country level. One attempt was to make the UN premises more accessible. An assessment on the accessibility of the physical environment and services of all UN premises in China has been completed with support of the Accessibility Development Institute of Tsinghua University in 2021, with detailed recommendations provided for improvement. \nUNTGD provides a platform for international development partners to engage with OPDs. Currently, a few bilateral and multilateral donors such as the European Commission and British Council still have programs on disability. However, consultations show that international cooperation is increasingly scrutinized by authorities, and OPDs and local stakeholders are cautious about such engagement. \n1.6 Other Key Stakeholders (Academic, Private sector): Academic institutions or think tanks play an important role in the sector, due to their access to policy making channels. However, not all academics are aligned with the CRPD. OPDs are concerned that some academic institutions regard disability as an object of research but do not meaningfully engage OPDs, displacing rather than amplifying the voices of persons with disabilities. \nPrivate sector is increasingly active in disability inclusion, due to shifting funding structure for OPDs/CSOs, domestic policy incentives for disability-inclusive employment and services, and global corporate cultural change towards Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), and corporate social responsibility (CSR). A few social enterprises have been active in engaging the private sector. However, balancing the interests of business clients and the disability community is a challenge, which needs to involve different stakeholders, including government, disability advocates, and businesses themselves. A missed opportunity identified by informants is the lack of engagement with OPDs, reinforcing the fragmentation of limited resources of the field. Further, most businesses still lack the awareness of the social model of disability, taking a charity-based or tokenistic approach.",
            " with disabilities taking regular gaokao were issued. 126 As a result, more students with disabilities were able to attend the exam, but the acceptance rate remains disproportionately low. \nEmployment and livelihood \nThe right to equal employment opportunities is stipulated in China ’s Constitution, the Labor Law, the LPPD, and Regulations on the Employment of Disabled Persons (2007). The Employment Promotion Law (2007) also contains an anti-discrimination provision regarding people with disabilities. 127 As a priority area of China ’s state disability programs, employment is typically included in the national five-year plans for disability. The latest 14 th Five-Year Plan sets goals for diversifying the types and improving the quality of employment of persons with disabilities. In 2022, the State Council adopted the Three-Year Action Plan on Promoting Disability Employment (2022-2024), setting the target of generating one million new jobs for persons with disabilities over three years, creating an important policy momentum. \nAs a form of affirmative action, China has adopted an employment quota scheme, one of the most important policy devices for promoting employment of persons with disabilities.

            "Access to justice \nAccording to a UNDP China report on Equal Access to Justice for Persons with Disabilities, 142 persons with disabilities face significant challenges in accessing the justice system. These include: \n• “ Limited legal knowledge. \n• Unaffordability of current legal services, and the general lack of knowledge about free legal aid services. \n• For persons with [psychosocial] and intellectual disabilities and others who are placed under adult guardianship, their legal capacity is restricted. \n• In the process of providing criminal legal aid for persons with visual, hearing, speech and mental impairments, there is a lack of effective and timely support in communication and information accessibility. \n• For persons with physical or visual impairments, if and when they face discrimination in the realms of transportation, education and employment, they cannot resort to the judicial system for equality. \n• Women with disabilities are more vulnerable to rights infringement and have less access to justice. \n• Continuous social discrimination and prejudice that all [persons with disabilities] face critically restricts their ability to navigate the judicial system effectively in order to realize their human rights and also undermines their confidence and adds to their already existing dismay. ” The report concludes that the key to improving equal access to justice is greater accessibility support and reasonable accommodations throughout the judicial process. \nParticipation in public and political life China is not short of policies and laws that protect the political participation right of persons with disabilities on paper. The 2008 LPPD stipulates that “ Persons with disabilities shall enjoy equal rights with other citizens in political, economic, cultural and social respects and in family life as well ” (Article 3) and that “ competent departments in charge of the organization of elections shall facilitate persons with disabilities to vote in elections. Braille ballots shall be available wherever possible ” (Article 56). 143 Mechanisms for participating in public and political life for persons with disabilities in China include taking",

            "2023 marks the 15 th year since China has ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2008. The landscape of disability inclusion in China has been undergoing deep transformation. This Situational Analysis provides an overview of the five preconditions for disability inclusion, as defined by the United Nations Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNPRPD) — equality and non-discrimination, inclusive service delivery, accessibility, CRPD compliant budgeting, and accountability and governance; and three cross-cutting issues including participation, inequalities, and gender. For each area of inquiry, the analysis follows the research questions provided by the UNPRPD, in identifying the gaps and opportunities to inform future development programs. The analysis is primarily based on secondary literature review, supplemented with consultations, carried out between March 2023 and June 2023. \nEquality and Non-Discrimination: China has more than 80 laws and 50 administrative regulations directly related to the interests of persons with disabilities, and regularly updated its national strategy for disability since 1991. Translating these commitments into better inclusion requires efforts to better align disabilityrelated policies and laws with the social model of disability, meaningfully engage OPDs independent from the state in decision making, and fully implement accessibility, reasonable accommodations, and antidiscrimination provisions. Culturally, the charity or medical model of disability remains dominant in public attitudes. \nAccessibility: China has issued more than 450 regulations, rules and normative documents on accessibility implementation and management. In recent years, campaigns are carried out to improve access to information. A further welcoming development is the new Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, passed on June 28, 2023. The effects of these policies depend on strong enforcement, sufficient remedies, and the meaningful engagement of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessibility tools and rules, with considerations of diverse needs among marginalized communities, such as deaf people/persons with hearing impairments, persons with intellectual disabilities, and persons with psychosocial disabilities. \nInclusive Service Delivery: Among 85 million officially estimated persons with disabilities, 38 million (44.7%) hold a disability certificate as of 2021. The task for service provision is daunting given the huge and diverse demands, and China has reached impressive coverage of services, especially in social protection and rehabilitation. To better align with the CRPD, the next step is to shift the focus from welfare provision to social inclusion, from special needs to inclusive services. This would require better rights awareness, accessibility, and reasonable accommodations in mainstream services, such as health, education, and employment; stronger support for caregiving instead of demanding family responsibilities; and more equitable allocation of resources for marginalized communities, such as persons with disabilities in rural areas, persons with severe or multiple disabilities, women with disabilities, and persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: According to the Ministry of Finance, in 2021, the national public budget expenditure on disability affairs was CNY 70.6 billion, roughly 0.287% of the total national general public budget expenditure. Majority of the disability budget (43.3%) was spent on living and care subsidies. Inclusive services such as inclusive education and employment, as championed by the CRPD, need stronger financial support. \nAccountability and governance: The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recommends an independent mechanism appointed to monitor the implementation of the CRPD. The CDPF regularly collects data from disability certificate holders and publishes annual updates in its key mandates, yet the data is not specifically aligned with the definition of disability or priority areas of the CRPD or SDGs. Data disaggregated by disability in mainstream statistical efforts need enhancement.",

While development partners are reducing support for countries like China as its income level grows, development programs funded by foreign entities are under increasing legal and administrative scrutiny. This has impacted the development of independent OPDs which lack access to government resources.",
            "2. Equality and non-discrimination \n2.1 Legislative and policy context \nChina has ratified the CRPD in 2008, without ratifying its Optional Protocol. Under Article 35 of the CRPD, China completed its first periodic report in 2012, and second and third combined in 2018. Review of the latest report concluded in September 2022. On 5 February 2022, China ratified the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled. Other international human rights treaties that China ratified include Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), Convention against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), and International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD). 31 Reporting for CEDAW and CRC typically include references to persons with disabilities. \nOfficially, China has more than 80 laws and 50 administrative regulations directly related to the interests of persons with disabilities. 32 The main legislation stipulating the rights of persons with disabilities in China is the Law on the Protection of Disabled Persons (LPPD), first enacted in 1990 and amended in 2008 in anticipation of the CRPD ratification. Legal experts point out that significant gaps still exist between the 2008 LPPD and the CRPD, including, but not limited to, the lack of provisions of reasonable accommodation, equal recognition before law, and full inclusion of women and children with disabilities, and the law ’s prioritization of prevention and rehabilitation of disability based on medical definitions of disability. 33 A crucial gap lies in the difference in definitions of disability between the LPPD and CRPD, leading to different approaches to addressing disability-related issues. The LPPD (2008) defines a person with disabilities as “ one who has abnormalities of loss of a certain organ or function, psychologically or physiologically, or in anatomical structure and has lost wholly or in part the ability to perform an activity in the way considered normal. ” 34 \nIn addition to the LPPD, major legislations include the 2017 Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities, the 2017 Regulations on the Education of Persons with Disabilities, the Regulations on the Employment of the Disabled, and the 2012 Regulations on the Construction of Barrier-free Environments, 35 and the 2012 Mental Health Law. China ’s first Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments solicited public comments for drafts in 2022 and 2023, and was passed on June 28, 2023, which presents a key policy window for accessibility advocacy. \nChina does not have a general anti-discrimination framework or legislation, 36 although disability related laws are “ against disability-based discrimination ” in principle. The current laws and policies do not have a clear definition of disability-based discrimination, making it difficult for judicial determination of discrimination. 37 The provision of reasonable accommodation is not yet included in all relevant laws and policies, and lacks clear guidance on implementation and effective remedies. 38 As a step forward, some local regulations began explicitly referencing reasonable accommodations. 39 Major progress was made in the national college entrance examination (gaokao) system. Since 2014, there has been policy development for students with disabilities to apply for reasonable accommodations to take gaokao. Statistics show that, in 2017, 5626 students with disabilities applied for reasonable accommodation for gaokao. Advocates call for expanding such progress to more areas such as exams for public servants, high school entrance exams, and judicial exams. 40",

            "6. Accountability and governance \n6.1 Inclusive evidence and data gathering systems \nTwo national sample surveys on disability were conducted in 1987 and 2006. There is no updated national disability sample survey so far. The CDPF and its local branches publish annual data updates, including statistical briefs and yearbooks on disability affairs. Key priorities of the DPF system are monitored, including rehabilitation, education, employment, social protection, poverty reduction, culture, sports, and rights protection. Other data collection efforts include the annual income level survey for households of persons with disabilities since 2017, conducted by the CDPF with the approval of the National Statistics Bureau, sampling over 10,000 households every year. 159 \nA recent initiative of China ’s disability data system is a national database that regularly and comprehensively collects information from all disability certificate holders, across the country. Key data is publicized on CDPF ’s website, and accessible for public use: https://www.cdpf.org.cn/zwgk/zccx/ndsj/zhsjtj/2021zh/87373b76fe2e47789b24f2d481afebbc.htm. \nData in some thematic areas are disaggregated by age, types of disability, and location, but not by gender. Existing data do not assess barriers to participation, or intersectional issues related to disability other than poverty. Data experts consulted raised concerns about the reliability of self-reported data by local governments, and the limited scope of disability certificate holders. \nA common response among informants is the general lack of reliable data on disability, let alone data specifically aligned with the disability definition of the CRPD, or SDG indicators. Government informants https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/90124/CC035_12_03_Disability_Workplace_China_Situation_Assess.pdf?sequence=1 \nalso note the lack of disaggregated data by disability in national statistical datasets across sectors. The data gaps and opportunities that informants identified include: \n• an updated accounting of the number of persons with disabilities based on definitions aligned with the CRPD, including those without the disability certificates; \n• data on people who newly acquired disabilities; \n• data on marginalized communities, such as persons with psychosocial disabilities, women with disabilities, and persons with disabilities residing in rural areas; \n• inclusive education, and employment data disaggregated by types of disabilities; \n• language use (Chinese sign language, written Chinese, signing exact Chinese) among people with hearing impairments \n• economic impact of the employment of persons with disabilities, including on their families and communities; \n• and mainstream, national data disaggregated by disability.",
            "OPDs consulted for the report identified the following key gaps in accessibility as the most urgent: low public awareness of accessibility, weak enforcement of laws and standards, and the lack of participation of persons with disabilities in designing, monitoring, and evaluating accessibility. Expert informants note that enforcement of accessibility policies requires strong inter-ministerial coordination, which DPFs lack sufficient authority for. Awareness of local government leadership and the support of more powerful ministries is crucial. OPDs are also calling for strengthening the digital literacy of persons with disabilities, which is positively correlated with income levels in China. 64 A CDPF joined study found that due to lack of internet access or devices, prohibition by parents, and insufficient skills to use accessibility features, the usage rate of internet among youth with disabilities (aged 10-18) is merely 68%, significantly lower than youth without disabilities (94.9%). 65 While digital tools are important means of production, there lacks systemic assessment of the digital literacy of persons with disabilities. \n4. Inclusive Service Delivery \n4.1 Disability assessment and referral systems \nChina ’s current disability determination system does not align with the CRPD ’s social model definition of disability, or the WHO classification system. The Classification and Grading Criteria for Disability (GB/T 26341-2010) provides national standards for six types of disability, namely visual impairment/blind, Hearing impairment/deaf, Physical disability, Speech disability, Intellectual disability, and Psychiatric disabilities, with four grades under each type. Legal determination of disability is conducted by designated medical institutions, and the recognition of disability comes in the form of a certificate issued by the CDPF, which is a prerequisite for applying for disability subsidies and functions as an identification to access a range of benefits and services. Early i dentification and intervention mechanisms for children aged 0-6 are promoted by the N ational Disability Prevention Action Plan (2021-2025) and the Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities (2017). In 2021, 278,695 children with disabilities received basic rehabilitation services nationwide. 66 Quality of the services, disaggregated by type of disability, location, and gender, needs further assessment. \nPredominantly based on biomedical criteria, the system does not account for the social and environmental factors that affect people ’s capacity to undertake activities of daily life and participation. The determination criteria also prioritize people who could not recover after receiving treatment for over a year, and does not account for temporary impairments. 67 \nThe DPFs regularly update and monitor data of certified persons with disabilities, as basis for service provision and policy making. Among 85 million officially estimated persons with disabilities, only 38 million (44.7%) hold a disability certificate as of 2021, and 57.8% of them are men. 68 The low rate of certificate holding is in part due to stigma, lack of information, inaccessibility of the determination system, and 68中国残疾人联合会.

            "2023 marks the 15 th year since China has ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2008. The landscape of disability inclusion in China has been undergoing deep transformation. This Situational Analysis provides an overview of the five preconditions for disability inclusion, as defined by the United Nations Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNPRPD) — equality and non-discrimination, inclusive service delivery, accessibility, CRPD compliant budgeting, and accountability and governance; and three cross-cutting issues including participation, inequalities, and gender. For each area of inquiry, the analysis follows the research questions provided by the UNPRPD, in identifying the gaps and opportunities to inform future development programs. The analysis is primarily based on secondary literature review, supplemented with consultations, carried out between March 2023 and June 2023. \nEquality and Non-Discrimination: China has more than 80 laws and 50 administrative regulations directly related to the interests of persons with disabilities, and regularly updated its national strategy for disability since 1991. Translating these commitments into better inclusion requires efforts to better align disabilityrelated policies and laws with the social model of disability, meaningfully engage OPDs independent from the state in decision making, and fully implement accessibility, reasonable accommodations, and antidiscrimination provisions. Culturally, the charity or medical model of disability remains dominant in public attitudes. \nAccessibility: China has issued more than 450 regulations, rules and normative documents on accessibility implementation and management. In recent years, campaigns are carried out to improve access to information. A further welcoming development is the new Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, passed on June 28, 2023. The effects of these policies depend on strong enforcement, sufficient remedies, and the meaningful engagement of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessibility tools and rules, with considerations of diverse needs among marginalized communities, such as deaf people/persons with hearing impairments, persons with intellectual disabilities, and persons with psychosocial disabilities. \nInclusive Service Delivery: Among 85 million officially estimated persons with disabilities, 38 million (44.7%) hold a disability certificate as of 2021. The task for service provision is daunting given the huge and diverse demands, and China has reached impressive coverage of services, especially in social protection and rehabilitation. To better align with the CRPD, the next step is to shift the focus from welfare provision to social inclusion, from special needs to inclusive services. This would require better rights awareness, accessibility, and reasonable accommodations in mainstream services, such as health, education, and employment; stronger support for caregiving instead of demanding family responsibilities; and more equitable allocation of resources for marginalized communities, such as persons with disabilities in rural areas, persons with severe or multiple disabilities, women with disabilities, and persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: According to the Ministry of Finance, in 2021, the national public budget expenditure on disability affairs was CNY 70.6 billion, roughly 0.287% of the total national general public budget expenditure. Majority of the disability budget (43.3%) was spent on living and care subsidies. Inclusive services such as inclusive education and employment, as championed by the CRPD, need stronger financial support. \nAccountability and governance: The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recommends an independent mechanism appointed to monitor the implementation of the CRPD. The CDPF regularly collects data from disability certificate holders and publishes annual updates in its key mandates, yet the data is not specifically aligned with the definition of disability or priority areas of the CRPD or SDGs. Data disaggregated by disability in mainstream statistical efforts need enhancement.",
            "#11EN-Children with disabilities Atlas 2018.pdf\n##Statistics on persons with disabilities\nData and research on the status of persons with disabilities has provided importantevidence for policy development. China conducted the first and second NationalSample Survey on Disability in 1987 and 2006, respectively. The 2006 survey,2conducted in 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities of mainlandChina, sampled around 772,000 households and 2.53 million people, includingapproximately 620,000 children aged 0–17. The survey found that the total number ofpersons with disabilities in 2006 was 82.96 million, accounting for 6.3 per cent3 ofChina’s total population. About 6.1 per cent of all persons with disabilities werechildren, in other words, about five million children have some type of disability,accounting for 1.6 per cent of the total number of children in the country. This surveyprovided nationally representative data and reflected the overall situation of childrenwith disabilities.\nIn order to further monitor the situation of persons with disabilities after the 2006National Sample Survey on Disability, the China Disabled Persons' Federation(CDPF) continued to monitor the situation nationwide for eight consecutive yearsfrom 2007 to 2014, and regularly issued the Monitoring Reports on Disabled People'sSituation and Well-off Progress in China.\nSince 2008, the CDPF has combined the issuance of the second-generation People'sRepublic of China Disability Card with the collection and management of basicpopulation information of persons with disabilities in possession of the DisabilityCard. Additionally, through the Ministry of Public Security's National CitizenshipInformation Service System, CDPF oversaw identity authentication and establishedthe National Basic Population Database of Persons with Disabilities.4 By the end of2017, the database had basic information on more than 34 million persons withdisabilities in possession of the Disability Card, including 1.22 million children withdisabilities aged 0–17. Possessing the Disability Card will increase children’s accessto targeted social services and government support.\nAt the beginning of 2015, the State Council Working Committee on Disabilityorganized the National Special Survey on the Status and Needs of Basic Services forPersons with Disabilities (2015 Special Survey),5 specifically gathering information onpersons with disabilities registered in the Population Database. Subsequent annualupdates were conducted, which provided rich data for in-depth analysis of thesituation of persons with disabilities, including children with disabilities.",

Consultations for this report reveal that mainstream medical system remain largely inaccessible, or unaffordable for certain communities of persons with rare diseases, and adopts a strong medical model of disability that fails to connect the patients ’ medical needs with social services. \nAccess to general healthcare is uneven. A recent analysis based on data from the National Survey on Basic Public Service Delivery of Persons with Disabilities revealed high rate of unmet healthcare needs. 15.4% of persons with disabilities lacked regular medical care when ill, and 45.6% reported needing more targeted rehabilitation services than they had. Rural residents were 13-40% more likely to lack healthcare, which was in part the result of the unequal access to health facilities, social participation, and health professionals at the community level. Among the respondents, persons with multiple disabilities experienced the highest levels of overall unmet healthcare needs, and people with physical disabilities had more unmet needs in rehabilitation. 100 Further, among China ’s over five million children with disabilities, 63% did not receive adequate healthcare, due to poor information, shortage of services, and affordability. 101 General health data disaggregated by disability, such as evidence of inequalities in health faced by persons with disabilities (corresponds to the OHCHR CRPD-SDG indicators) are not available. \nSexual and Reproductive Health and Rights Women with disabilities face additional barriers in accessing healthcare, especially sexual and reproductive health (SRH). 102 Women and youth with disabilities face higher risks of sexual violence, forced abortion, contraception and sterilization, financial and other forms of control, 103 yet they have limited access to SRH information and services. 104 In a UNESCO China and Humanity & Inclusion study, less than 20% young persons with disabilities in both urban and rural areas reported having counselling, referral services, or free contraceptives in their schools or communities. 105 A study co-funded by the CDPF \n105 Ibid. \nand State Council Committee on Women and Children ’s Work revealed large gaps in disabled women ’s access to healthcare and rehabilitation services. For instance, in Heilongjiang province, merely 50.2% women with disabilities received prenatal check during their last childbirth, 20.4 percentage points lower than women in general. Women with disabilities in rural areas had an even lower prenatal checking rate of 36.2%, and were significantly less likely (46.7 p"

            "6.2 National accountability mechanisms \nOfficially, the State Council Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work is responsible for promoting the implementation of the CRPD. Information on the effectiveness of the Committee in mainstreaming CRPD across all sectors and levels of government is lacking. 160 There is no independent mechanism appointed to monitor the implementation of the CRPD. 161 \nThe CDPF is the focal point overseeing the implementation of the CRPD, responsible for monitoring whether the creation and implementation of policies and plans relating to the rights of persons with disabilities are consistent with the CRPD principles. Some CSOs were invited to consultations for CRPD reporting but OPDs were underrepresented. 162 Most CSOs involved were specialized associations funded by the CDPF, or service provision organizations led by people without disabilities. In 2018, the State Council Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work published China ’s draft CRPD country report for public opinions, but the time window was fewer than 24 hours, making it impractical for meaningful comments to be incorporated. 163 A few OPDs have engaged in CRPD monitoring through shadow reporting, but most OPDs consulted have not engaged in CRPD monitoring mechanisms. \nChina has completed its combined second and third periodic reports. The review sessions concluded in September 2022. Major findings of the concluding observations suggest that China ’s disability-related policies and laws are not yet fully aligned with the social model of disability, OPDs independent from the state lack meaningful participation in policy-making, and China ’s legal system lacks anti-discrimination frameworks and effective provisions guaranteeing reasonable accommodations. 164 \nIn China ’s National Plan on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 165 disability was explicitly mentioned in China ’s action plan for goal 4 (quality education), 8 (decent work and economic growth), and 10 (reduced inequalities). In China ’s Progress Report on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2021), persons with disabilities were reported as beneficiaries of China ’s progress on SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG4 (quality education), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). 166 Concrete achievements include: \n• “ To ensure the right to education for people with disabilities, the second phase of the Special Educational Enhancement Program was fully completed from 2017 to 2020. By the end of 2020, the enrollment rate of children with disabilities in compulsory education exceeded 95%; a total of 880,800 special education students had been enrolled, 388,800 more than in 2016. ” \n• “ From 2016 to 2020, 1.81 million people with disabilities got employed in urban and rural areas. As of the end of 2020, 2.39 million people with disabilities obtained flexible employment (including community and home employment). ” 167 \nIn China ’s 2021 Voluntary National Review, people with disabilities are mentioned as beneficiaries of China ’s efforts in SDG 1.5, the world ’s largest social security system, and COVID response. No specific evidence was provided regarding the implementation of the disability-related goals listed in China ’s Action Plan. 168",

The empirical evidence presented here, based on a large sample size from across China, demonstrates that fathers of children with ID tend to have less positive perceptions of their children than do fathers of children with OCHC. 56.1% of fathers of children with ID believe their children are usually or always harder to raise than other children, while only 2.3% of fathers of children with OCHC feel this way. Fathers of children with ID are more likely than fathers of children with OCHC to report that their children often do things that irritate them (36.6% vs.1.7%) and that they more often feel angry towards their children (45.6% vs. 15.3).This is one of only a few studies to use fathers’ perceptions of family functioning to examine overall well-being of families of children with ID. Compared to fathers of children with OCHC, fewer fathers of children with ID believe that the family, when facing problems, would talk together with other family members (63.3% vs. 86.3%), work together to solve their child’s problem (66.0% vs. 88.0%), have strengths to draw on to solve problems (61.5% vs. 90.4%), or stay hopeful in difficult times (66.8% vs. 94.4%). These results indicate that, for fathers of children with ID, family functioning can be problematic. A possible explanation is that distinct challenges associated with ID cause fathers to be overly occupied with their children’s maladaptive behaviors (Marsh et al.\n2018) and thereby have less time and opportunity to interact with their spouses.When facing problems raising their children with ID or OCHC, fathers tend to rely on family members or friends as primary sources of emotional support. This finding is consistent with earlier studies that show that support providers primarily come from inside the family (Turnbull et al.\n2018, Kyzar et al.",

A Kolmogorov–Smirnov test showed that the distribution of GHQ did conform to the normal distribution (p < 0.001). Combined with the P–P plots, the data distribution can be considered as a slightly positively skewed distribution [33]. As previous studies have reported, one-way analysis of variance can be used when the sample size is greater than 50 [34]. In this study, a total of 1450 individuals participated, therefore the one-way analysis of variance could be utilized. Levene’s test of homogeneity of variance showed that the variance of each group was not homogeneous (p < 0.001); Tamhane’s T2 was used to perform multiple comparisons.Overall, the results showed that there were significant differences in the mental health of parents with different types of special needs children (F (2, 1447) = 4.05, p = 0.02, η2 = 0.01). Parents of children with autism spectrum disorder were more likely to have mental health problems compared to parents of children with a visual or hearing impairment (p = 0.03). There were also marginal significant differences between parents of children with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities (p = 0.08). However, there was no significant difference between parents of children with an intellectual disability and those with a visual or hearing impairment (p = 0.66). Ranked by mean mental health scores, parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (M = 2.88, SD = 3.43) was first, followed by an intellectual disability (M = 2.45, SD = 3.25) and a visual or hearing impairment (M = 2.24, SD = 2.99). 3.2. Mental Health Status Among Parents of Children with Autism Spectrum DisorderPearson’s correlation coefficient analyses were performed to explore the factors related to parents’ mental health. The results showed that parents’ mental health was positively related to behavioral problems in children (r = 0.22, p < 0.001), psychological demand of parents (r = 0.31, p < 0.001), parenting distress (r = 0.38, p < 0.001), parent–child dysfunctional interaction (r = 0.36, p < 0.001), and difficult child (r = 0.27, p < 0.001); whereas it was negatively related to family support (r = −0.23, p < 0.001), friend support (r = −0.18, p < 0.001), and other necessary support (r = 0.22, p < 0.001).Hierarchical linear regression analyses were used to explore the factors predicting parents’ mental health, and parents’ mental health scores were the dependent variable (see Table 2). Demographic variables were entered in the first model as control variables, and the second model included behavioral problems of children, psychological demands of parents, parenting stress (including parenting distress, parent–child dysfunctional interactions, difficult child), and social support (including family support, friend support, and other necessary support). The maximum variance inflation (VIF) was 4.57, indicating that there was no multicollinearity between independent variables.Table 2Hierarchical linear regression analysis among parents of children with autism spectrum disorder.ModelsVariables\nB\nSE\nβ\nt\n95% CI\nR2\nF",

            "6.2 National accountability mechanisms \nOfficially, the State Council Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work is responsible for promoting the implementation of the CRPD. Information on the effectiveness of the Committee in mainstreaming CRPD across all sectors and levels of government is lacking. 160 There is no independent mechanism appointed to monitor the implementation of the CRPD. 161 \nThe CDPF is the focal point overseeing the implementation of the CRPD, responsible for monitoring whether the creation and implementation of policies and plans relating to the rights of persons with disabilities are consistent with the CRPD principles. Some CSOs were invited to consultations for CRPD reporting but OPDs were underrepresented. 162 Most CSOs involved were specialized associations funded by the CDPF, or service provision organizations led by people without disabilities. In 2018, the State Council Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work published China ’s draft CRPD country report for public opinions, but the time window was fewer than 24 hours, making it impractical for meaningful comments to be incorporated. 163 A few OPDs have engaged in CRPD monitoring through shadow reporting, but most OPDs consulted have not engaged in CRPD monitoring mechanisms. \nChina has completed its combined second and third periodic reports. The review sessions concluded in September 2022. Major findings of the concluding observations suggest that China ’s disability-related policies and laws are not yet fully aligned with the social model of disability, OPDs independent from the state lack meaningful participation in policy-making, and China ’s legal system lacks anti-discrimination frameworks and effective provisions guaranteeing reasonable accommodations. 164 \nIn China ’s National Plan on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 165 disability was explicitly mentioned in China ’s action plan for goal 4 (quality education), 8 (decent work and economic growth), and 10 (reduced inequalities). In China ’s Progress Report on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2021), persons with disabilities were reported as beneficiaries of China ’s progress on SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG4 (quality education), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). 166 Concrete achievements include: \n• “ To ensure the right to education for people with disabilities, the second phase of the Special Educational Enhancement Program was fully completed from 2017 to 2020. By the end of 2020, the enrollment rate of children with disabilities in compulsory education exceeded 95%; a total of 880,800 special education students had been enrolled, 388,800 more than in 2016. ” \n• “ From 2016 to 2020, 1.81 million people with disabilities got employed in urban and rural areas. As of the end of 2020, 2.39 million people with disabilities obtained flexible employment (including community and home employment). ” 167 \nIn China ’s 2021 Voluntary National Review, people with disabilities are mentioned as beneficiaries of China ’s efforts in SDG 1.5, the world ’s largest social security system, and COVID response. No specific evidence was provided regarding the implementation of the disability-related goals listed in China ’s Action Plan. 168",
            "Higher education \nHigher education remains largely inaccessible to persons with disabilities. As of 2019, a total of 43,900 persons with disabilities were enrolled in regular college in the entire country, 123 which means roughly 10,000 persons with disabilities graduate from college every year. By contrast, the number of college graduates without disabilities in 2020 was 8.74 million, 124 over 800 times more than persons with disabilities. Barriers faced by persons with disabilities prior to higher education include low primary school enrolment rate among persons with disabilities in rural areas, high dropout rate among children with disabilities, low educational expectation for persons with disabilities due to deeply entrenched stigma, inadequate support in school including reasonable accommodations, and limited options in colleges and majors open to persons with disabilities. 125 Due to continued advocacy, in 2014, a national policy began to allow the application for reasonable accommodations in the national college entrance exam (gaokao), and in 2017, rules on supporting students with disabilities taking regular gaokao were issued. 126 As a result, more students with disabilities were able to attend the exam, but the acceptance rate remains disproportionately low. \nEmployment and livelihood \nThe right to equal employment opportunities is stipulated in China ’s Constitution, the Labor Law, the LPPD, and Regulations on the Employment of Disabled Persons (2007). The Employment Promotion Law (2007) also contains an anti-discrimination provision regarding people with disabilities. 127 As a priority area of China ’s state disability programs, employment is typically included in the national five-year plans for disability. The latest 14 th Five-Year Plan sets goals for diversifying the types and improving the quality of employment of persons with disabilities. In 2022, the State Council adopted the Three-Year Action Plan on Promoting Disability Employment (2022-2024), setting the target of generating one million new jobs for persons with disabilities over three years, creating an important policy momentum. \nAs a form of affirmative action, China has adopted an employment quota scheme, one of the most important policy devices for promoting employment of persons with disabilities. Implemented in the late 1980s, this nationwide, legally binding scheme applies to all public and private sector organizations with a workforce exceeding 30 employees and operating for more than 3 years. It stipulates that at least 1.5% of all public or private entities ’ workforce must be persons with a disability, and non-compliance shall result in financial penalty paid to the Disabled Employment Security Fund (DESF), managed by the CDPF. 128 In practice, the quota policy has been poorly enforced, and even created perverse incentives such as “ fake employment ” practices that rent a disabled person ’s certificate as a token of compliance without real work opportunity. 129 Some OPDs point out that the policy may have caused more disability-based discrimination. 130 Consultations further show the complexity of the issue. Many persons with disabilities, due to systemic education and employment exclusion, end up depending on the income from renting their certificates to private companies. The funding scheme also contains a conflict of interest, as some local governments rely on DESF as a source of revenue, incentivizing officials to collect more fines than promoting real employment. 131",

Preferential policies and measures of support and protection shall be adopted with a view to gradually popularizing, stabilizing and rationalizing employment of disabled persons through multiple channels, at various levels and in a variety of forms.\nArticle 29 The State and society shall set up welfare enterprises for disabled persons, workers sanatoria, massage therapy centres and other enterprises and institutions of welfare nature as a way of providing concentrated employment for disabled persons.\nArticle 30 The State shall promote the employment of disabled persons by various units.

            "4.2 Disability Support Services \nThe 13 th Five-Year Plan to Promote Equal Provision of Basic Public Services dedicated a section on basic services for persons with disabilities, including social protection, nursing care, rehabilitation, education, vocational training and employment services, culture and sports, and accessible environment support. 70 The 14 th five-year plan on disability aims to increase the access, availability and diversity of support allowances and services. CDPF is the main coordinator of service provision for persons with disabilities. 71 Disability support services are mainly funded by the government, and delivered through direct service or government procurement of services from public institutions, registered social organizations including social workers, or private service providers. 72 According to the Disabled Persons Service Provider Management Measures (2018), CDPF and its branches are commissioned to supervise disability service providers. Local government departments shall make plans for service provision based on the population size, distribution, and service needs of persons with disabilities in their jurisdiction, and include service providers in the basic public service system. Service providers are required to conduct needs assessment and evaluation to design and update services, and provide accessible facilities. 73 Most public services are provided for disability certificate holders within local jurisdictions with low or no cost. \nDue to the variety and decentralization of services, the general number of service providers to persons with disabilities ratio is unknown. A key grassroots service coordination mechanism within the DPF system is the “ special commissioners on disability issues, ” who are typically persons with disabilities or their family members, responsible for home visits, needs assessment, local-level disability work planning, policy coordination, event organizing, and conflict resolution. 74 As of 2021, there are 57,208 commissioners at the county level, and 494,047 commissioners at village and community levels across China. 75 This means, roughly 15 community-level DPF staff are hired to support per 1000 disability certificate holders, and their numbers are unevenly distributed geographically. More full-time commissioners are concentrated in urban areas, and commissioners in rural areas often combine multiple roles of coordinating disability, civil affairs, women ’s issues in one person. 76 The commissioners are often overworked, under-equipped, and under-skilled. 77 Informants note that the commissioners do not usually work with independent OPDs.",
            "The overall labor participation rate remains low for persons with disabilities. Although official data estimates over half of working-age people with disabilities are employed, 132 about three quarters of these jobs are categorized as either agriculture, cultivation, or “ flexible ” employment, 133 namely temporary or part-time jobs (see Figure 1). Persons with disabilities are significantly less likely to work in higher skilled white-collar occupations. 134 As key targets of poverty alleviation, as of 2018, households of persons with disabilities earned less than 60% of the national average and the gap continues to widen. 135 Among all, persons with intellectual disabilities were least accepted by employers. According to a report based on surveys of 203 families in Guangzhou, only 2% of persons with intellectual disabilities in Guangzhou had meaningful employment. 136 A recent survey of 328 companies shows that 70.4% persons with disabilities hired by these employers are people with physical impairments, and 59.8% are in supporting or administrative roles. 137 \n131 In consultation, informants have identified multiple systemic barriers to inclusive employment, including: \n• inadequate access to equal education opportunities, including the lack of high-quality basic education, as well as vocational training and skill development opportunities for persons with disabilities; \n• the lack of anti-discrimination and disability mainstreaming laws and policies; \n• lack of public sector role models for disability-inclusive employment; \n• lack of disability inclusion expertise among employment service providers; \n• discriminatory social attitudes towards persons with disabilities by families and friends, employers, co-workers, and even persons with disabilities themselves; \n• Lack of accessibility and reasonable accommodations to and at workplaces. \nILO ’s Global Business and Disability Network (GBDN) China Chapter has made progress in influencing the private sector to recruit and include persons with disabilities. While attracting local companies to join GBDN-China and promoting inclusive employment practices remains a challenge, GBDN-China presents an opportunity to generate good practices and share experiences with other companies in China.",

            "7. Cross cutting issues \n7.1 Participation \nWithin the government system, there exist formal mechanisms to facilitate OPD participation in policymaking and decision-making. For instance, the Disabled People ’s Representative Congress, which is meant to function as the disabled persons ’ equivalent of the National People ’s Congress, represents the highest power overseeing the CDPF and is required to reserve at least half of its seats to persons with disabilities and their families/friends. 171 The five specialized associations, predominantly functioning as internal parts of the DPFs, are dedicated to serving the interests of people with the kinds of disabilities they represent, and are usually headed by people with the same kinds of disabilities or their families/friends. The CDPF also encourages more persons with disabilities and their families/friends to become NPC and CPPCC delegates. \n167 Ibid. \nOPDs independent from the government are involved in policy-making and decision-making to a much less extent, as consultations show. Most laws and regulations concerning disability pass without the formal input of non-state affiliated OPDs. An exception is the recent draft Law on Construction of BarrierFree Environments. The draft law was open for public comments in 2022 and 2023, and multiple OPDs organized public consultations and submitted comments. Results of their advocacy remain to be seen. Despite the lack of formal engagement, some independent OPDs have leveraged informal channels through key decision-makers, academics, NPC and CPPCC delegates to influence policy and law making. For instance, informants note that the inclusion of accessibility provisions in the Legal Aid Law was achieved through OPD collaboration with academic think tanks. \nConsultations show that formal mechanisms for participation tend to be highly selective, and exclusively accessed by CSOs, OPDs, or individuals with disabilities that are affiliated with or endorsed by the government, who take a rather service-oriented than rights-based approach. Most formal mechanisms are symbolic. As informants comment, meaningful dialogues are difficult due to power imbalances, and a lack of recognition of OPDs ’ leadership in disability inclusion. Meanwhile, the effect of informal mechanisms is not guaranteed, and depends highly on personal circumstances and political opportunities. Most grassroots OPDs, in reality, lack access to such mechanisms. Comprehensive assessment of different approaches for OPDs to influence decision making is not available, and is worthy of future research. \nAccording to various stakeholders, key areas of improvement for OPDs to make engagement with duty bearers include: better knowledge of existing policies; more access to official channels; stronger coordination between OPDs and policy makers/advocates (such as think thanks, scholars, and NPC/CPPCC representatives); higher awareness of the expertise and capacity of OPDs; and mechanisms that prioritizes the voices of independent OPDs.",
            "By 2017, China has issued 451 regulations, rules and normative documents on accessibility implementation and management. 44 The main regulation on accessibility is the Regulations on the Construction of Barrier-free Environments (2012), which stipulate that the construction and modification of roads, public buildings, public transport facilities, residential buildings and residential areas shall comply with the construction standards for barrier-free facilities. China also incorporated barrier-free construction into its national development plans, such as the Implementation Programme for Construction of Barrier-Free Environments during the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (2016 –2020), and the National Plan on New Urbanization (2014 –2020). National accessibility standards (GB 50763-2012) have also been adopted. Comprehensive data about the application of the technical standards are unavailable and should be addressed by future research. Accessibility is not yet mainstreamed into public procurement, according to government informants consulted. \nIn recent years, more attention has been paid to the accessibility of information and communications. In 2020, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and CDPF issued the Guiding Opinions on Promoting Information Accessibility, focusing on removing barriers of the affordability, devices, and services of information for persons with disabilities. 45 On 5 February 2022, China ratified the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled. In 2021, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology launched a whole year Action Plan to modify the accessibility of internet applications for elderly people and persons with disabilities, mitigating “ digital divides. ” 46 The Action Plan explicitly listed 158 websites and applications targeted for modification, ranging from those of governments, news outlets, airlines and railways, social media, and e-commerce, to search engines, banks, travel agencies, health services. By 2022, over 800 government entities modified their web accessibility, 320 websites passed an accessibility audit, and nearly 100 applications added accessibility features such as large fonts, high contrast, and easy to read pages. 47 The provision of accessible services such as sign language interpretation are mentioned in the Rule on the Construction of Accessible Environment, Guiding Opinions on Strengthening the Construction of Broadcasting and Television Public Service System, and National Basic Public Service Standards. China has also issued its Second National Sign Language and Braille Standardization Action Plan (2021-2025), and the Promotion Plan for National Universal Sign Language. \nIn 2022, the draft Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments solicited public opinions. The second draft was released for public comments in April 2023. The legislation is widely recognized as a catalytic opportunity for raising the awareness of accessibility, and specifying the implementation measures at the local level. Expert informants involved in the legislative process praised the draft law for emphasizing accessibility at the planning stage, and legally recognizing the universal benefits of accessibility. Controversies remain about how strict the enforcement will be. OPDs are concerned about the lack of clarity on accountability and remedies, 48 the insufficient attention to the needs of persons with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities, 49 and the significant room for discretion for duty-bearers to not comply with the law, 50 making it a symbolic law with “ no teeth. ”",
            "7. To establish meaningful mechanisms to enhance OPD participation and amplify the voices of persons with disabilities in UN supported programmes. For instance, within the UNPRPD program, pilot test a mechanism for OPDs to partner with scholars/CSOs/think tanks/associations on evidence-based policy advocacy. The latter stakeholders can function as intermediaries between grassroots OPDs and policy makers. The collaboration mechanism should combine OPDs ’ disability-specific expertise, with the allies ’ domain-specific expertise and government access (e.g. education, health/SRHR, employment, or accessibility), and produce joint products for policy advocacy (e.g. reports, policy proposals, internal briefings, or pilot programs). The mechanism should fully leverage OPDs ’ leadership and expertise in analyzing community needs, while strengthening OPDs ’ policy advocacy skills and local-level support networks. It should also serve to increase the disability inclusion awareness and capabilities of domain experts. OPDs shall play a leading role in the mechanism, with sufficient decision-making power at each stage of the project, rather than mere data collectors. The UN should aim for creating opportunities for de-bureaucratized, informal engagement among stakeholders. \n8. To strengthen the resources and capacity for grassroots OPDs to participate in policy making, implementation, and monitoring in UN funded programmes. This could serve as models of good practice for other local programmes. Leverage the UNPRPD program and platforms such as the UNTGD, to facilitate regular knowledge exchanges among OPDs and stakeholders on successful engagement with existing participation mechanisms. These can include best practices of partnering with governmenttrusted think tanks for policy advocacy, submitting proposals to the NPC and CPPCC sessions, engagement strategies with government entities, campaigns for mobilizing public comments on draft legislations, monitoring the implementation of accessibility standards, participation in UN human rights treaty mechanisms, and effective collaboration with the private sector. The UN should provide a safe space and allocate sufficient resources to ensure OPDs and individuals with disabilities with less access can benefit. \n9. To create platforms for capacity building and international exchange for grassroots OPDs. Although development funding is negligible compared to the scale of government budget on disability, resources for OPDs remain scarce. OPDs operating in similar social and economic contexts can share ideas and build peer-support networks. It can also increase the visibility of Chinese OPDs at the international level and share Chinese best practices with other countries. \n10. To prioritize women with disabilities and marginalized communities in the design of the PRPD program. Prioritize the leadership of women with disabilities in development programs, and support gender-sensitive approaches to disability programs, rather than merely including female participants in activities. Allocate sufficient financial and human resources to support the meaningful participation of marginalized communities, such as travel, lodging, personal assistance, and reasonable accommodations. \n11. To enhance disability and gender mutual mainstreaming within the UN system. The 2022 Disability Inclusion Scorecard Assessment shows that the UNCT still fall short in meeting Indicator 8 “ Joint programmes: Joint programmes contribute to disability inclusion ” and Indicator 9 “ Data: Strengthening data on persons with disabilities. ” OPDs expect the UN to further implement the United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy, and model best practices such as incorporating disability components, indicators, and OPDs in non-disability focused UN programs, employing persons with disabilities, enhancing the accessibility of UN offices and meetings, and increasing the collection and disclosure of data disaggregated by types of disability, degrees of disability, and location of persons with disabilities. \nwww.UNPRPD.org",
            "Analysis of key gaps and opportunities \nGaps \nEquality and non-discrimination: Attitudinal barriers are considered by stakeholders as one of the most fundamental challenges that cuts across all preconditions for inclusion. Progress has been made since the adoption of CRPD in 2008 in terms of awareness-raising of the social model of disability, especially among development partners and OPDs/CSOs. Yet the Chinese society at large and its corresponding systems are predominantly taking a medical model approach to disability, regarding persons with disabilities as subjects of charity and welfare in need of special rather than mainstream services. Policy makers and service providers, especially at grassroots levels, lack the awareness and buy-in of CRPD or the social model of disability. Laws and regulations relevant to disability are not fully aligned with the CRPD, and lack strength in enforcement and remedies. \nInclusive Service Delivery: The current policy frameworks tend to regard persons with disabilities as welfare beneficiaries more than rights holders. Public provision of disability support services prioritize social protection, subsidies, and rehabilitation, less focused on building support systems for the equal participation of persons with disabilities in society, such as inclusive education and employment. Policy makers are incentivized to maximize service coverage for the large population of persons with disabilities with limited resources, de-emphasizing the quality of services. The agency and autonomy of persons with disabilities is downplayed. As reflected in multi-stakeholder consultations, OPDs are concerned about the policy focus on family ’s responsibility in caregiving for persons with disabilities, without sufficient government support. \nAccessibility: Unchecked discrimination against persons with disabilities, combined with the lack of reasonable accommodations and accessibility, pose consistent barriers in all aspects of social participation of persons with disabilities. Despite increased government investment in accessibility, weak enforcement, insufficient remedies, and the lack of meaningful participation of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessible tools and standards has resulted in the poor quality of accessibility measures. As shown in the draft Law on the Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, there is also a tendency to prioritize physical environment over access to information and service provision, especially for persons with intellectual or psychosocial impairments, and deaf people/persons with hearing impairments. \nAccountability and Governance: Disability has not yet been mainstreamed into the current governance structure. The CDPF system is assigned the responsibility for disability inclusion but with insufficient authority to coordinate with other ministries. This relatively segregated coordination mechanism within the government, according to stakeholders consulted, can form barriers for OPDs to engage mainstream ministries and obtain resources from the government which are concentrated within the DPF system. Consistent data collections on disability inclusion aligned with the CRPD and SDGs are lacking. Official statistics on disability adopt impairment-based definitions of disability and does not comply with the ICF or CRPD definitions of disability. Further, stakeholders are concerned about the reliability of self-reported data, the transparency of data, and the lack of disaggregated data by disability in mainstream data collections. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: Despite the much larger size compared to development partners, government budgeting prioritizes welfare provision over rights protection, and special rather than mainstream services. Significant power and resource imbalances exist between the duty bearers and rights holders. While development partners are reducing support for countries like China as its income level grows, development programs funded by foreign entities are under increasing legal and administrative scrutiny. This has impacted the development of independent OPDs which lack access to government resources.",
            "eview and implementation of the UNSDCF will be made at the level of the Results Groups. \nSpecifically, under the UNSDCF Strategic Priority 1 “ People and Prosperity: Achieving innovation-driven, coordinated and shared development ”, Outcome 2 reads, “ People ’s lives in China are improved further as headways is made in ensuring access to childcare, education, healthcare services, elderly care, housing, and social assistance, and more people in China, including left-behind groups, benefit from equitable and high quality public services and social protection systems as well as accelerated efforts to reduced gender inequality and other forms of social inequality throughout the life-course. ” \nThe UN makes an effort to engage persons with disabilities and their representative organizations closely across ongoing programs at country level. One attempt was to make the UN premises more accessible. An assessment on the accessibility of the physical environment and services of all UN premises in China has been completed with support of the Accessibility Development Institute of Tsinghua University in 2021, with detailed recommendations provided for improvement. \nUNTGD provides a platform for international development partners to engage with OPDs. Currently, a few bilateral and multilateral donors such as the European Commission and British Council still have programs on disability. However, consultations show that international cooperation is increasingly scrutinized by authorities, and OPDs and local stakeholders are cautious about such engagement. \n1.6 Other Key Stakeholders (Academic, Private sector): Academic institutions or think tanks play an important role in the sector, due to their access to policy making channels. However, not all academics are aligned with the CRPD. OPDs are concerned that some academic institutions regard disability as an object of research but do not meaningfully engage OPDs, displacing rather than amplifying the voices of persons with disabilities. \nPrivate sector is increasingly active in disability inclusion, due to shifting funding structure for OPDs/CSOs, domestic policy incentives for disability-inclusive employment and services, and global corporate cultural change towa"

            "7.2 Inclusion of marginalised groups \nPeople with disabilities with low income \nThe correlation between poverty and disability is globally known, and China is no exception. Officially, over 7 million persons with disabilities have been lifted out of absolute poverty by 2021. 172 Yet persons with disabilities remain economically marginalized. Depending on the evaluation criteria, experts estimate that 36% to 44% of certified persons with disabilities in China can be considered under “ relative poverty. ” 173 As a CDPF official points out, households of persons with disabilities persistently earn less than 60% of the national average, and the gap continues to widen (see Figure 2). 174 \nHouseholds of persons with disabilities typically have “ high costs, low income. ” In 2018, healthcare expenses of families of persons with disabilities make up 26.3% of total household expenditures, 1.6 times that of the national average. The Engel's Coefficient (food expenditure to overall expenditure ratio) of persons with disabilities was as high as 40.9% in 2018, significantly higher than the national average (28.4%). 176 The least well-off among people with disabilities live in rural areas. In 2018, urban households of persons with disabilities earned 1.7 times more than rural households. Among the rural population with disabilities, over half have severe disabilities (holders of Level 1 or Level 2 certificates). 177 This indicates a greater gap in meeting their needs for care, accessibility, rehabilitation, assistive devices, basic public services, and work, exacerbating their poverty. \nPeople with intellectual and/or psychosocial disabilities People with intellectual disabilities fare the worst economically among all persons with disabilities. In 2018, the average personal annual income for people with intellectual disabilities was CNY 11,388.3, roughly 70% of the income of people with physical disabilities, the highest income group. Their average salary income was a mere CNY 1,600.4 per year, lowest among all persons with disabilities, indicating their lack of access to formal employment opportunities. 178 In consultation, parents are the primary caregivers of persons with intellectual disabilities. They lack support from the government and alternative options for caregiving, and are concerned about the absence of affordable, high-quality care as they reach older age or pass away. \nFor people with psychosocial disabilities, an early analysis based on the 2006 disability sample survey data found that “ psychiatric disability, ” as defined by Chinese law, was significantly correlated with poverty. 179 Expert informants are concerned that institutional paternalism and stigma has led to substituted decisionmaking instead of supported decision making that respects the person ’s autonomy, lack of recognition of legal capacity, and restricted social participation of persons with psychosocial disabilities. Although China ’s Mental Health Law stipulates the right to litigation and the principle of voluntary diagnosis and hospitalization, in judicial practices, persons with psychosocial disabilities still lack decision-making power and court decisions continue to emphasize the role of legal guardians and family members. 180 The scarcity of high-quality community-based services is also a reality.",

Methods Data were gathered from the Global Burden of Disease study. The prevalence \nand years lived with disability (YLDs) of intellectual disability among Chinese children and adolescents were compared with the global average by gender, age group, and severity of disability in 2019. Joinpoint regression model was used to analyze the trends in the prevalence and YLDs of intellectual disability among Chinese children and adolescents from 1990 to 2019. Results The prevalence and YLDs of intellectual disability among Chinese children and adolescents in 2019 were 1 522.65 per 100 000 (95%UI: 1 228.62 per 100 000-1 817.55 per 100 000) and 109.81 per 100 000 (95%UI: 72.15 per 100 000-158.09 per 100 000), respectively, which were lower than the global average. The prevalence and YLDs of severe intellectual disability in China were slightly higher than ·监测· \nthe global average. The average annual percent changes in the prevalence and YLDs of intellectual disability among Chinese children and adolescents were -0.23% (95%CI: -0.26%--0.21%, P<0.001) and 0.74% (95%CI: 0.66%-0.81%, P<0.001) from 1990 to 2019, respectively. The prevalence and YLDs of severe intellectual disability showed continuously increasing trends over the past 30 years. Conclusions The disease burden of intellectual disability among Chinese children and adolescents was lower than the global average in 2019, but severe intellectual disability was higher than the global average. The prevalence of intellectual disability among Chinese children and adolescents showed an overall decrease, while YLDs showed an increasing trend from 1990 to 2019. \n【 Key words 】 Intellectual disability; Prevalence; Years lived with disability; Trends \nFund programs: National Natural Science Foundation of China (41871360); National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFC1004303); Open Project of National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Birth Defects Prevention (ZD202002) \n智力残疾是一种发生在22岁之前，以智力功",

As of 2018, among local DPFs, 69.3% of municipal-level DPFs and 49.8% of county-level DPFs had staff members with disabilities. 146 As a step forward, in 2021, CDPF and four other ministries and departments issued a policy guidance regarding employing persons with disabilities in state organs, public institutions, and state-owned enterprises, explicitly requiring public sector employers to reasonably define the physical exam requirements for candidates with disabilities, and must not judge the candidates ’ health on the basis of their disability. 147 \n5. CRPD-compliant budgeting and financial management \nThere are three main mechanisms for the Chinese government to fund disability-related programs: regular public budget, special subsidy, and disability employment security fund (DESF). 148 From 2013 to 2017, the fiscal allocations from all levels of the government for persons with disabilities added up to over CNY 180 billion. 149 In 2021, the national public budget expenditure on disability affairs was CNY 70.6 billion, taking up 0.287% of the total national general public budget expenditure (24567.3 billion). 150 Compared to the scale of Chinese government budget (50-70 billion CNY per year), budgets of ongoing national development and humanitarian programs funded by international development partners are negligible. \nThe expenditures on disability affairs in 2021 included 30.6 billion on living and care subsidies (43.3%), 7.2 billion on rehabilitation, 6.6 billion on employment and poverty reduction, 5.5 billion on administrative costs, and 18.8 billion categorized as other expenditures. 151 In addition, CNY 16.1 billion of national public budget was spent on special education, 0.43% of the total education expenditures (3746.9 billion). 152 Article 48 of the 2017 Regulations on the Education of Persons with Disabilities stipulates that “ the financial funds allocated for compulsory education by local people ’s governments at all levels, as we"

            "A decade later, women with disabilities face continued barriers in care, marriage and social life, reproductive health care, and equal opportunities to employment, as shown in a women ’s OPD survey of 535 women with disabilities. 187 Another recent multi-year OPD survey of 1,083 women with disabilities reveals that as high as 33% of them were once told to discontinue their education. Among educated informants, 24% experienced dropout because of their disability. 54.3% of women studied were not employed, for whom caretaking responsibilities and unsuccessful job seeking are the main reasons. Over half of the women reported experiences of rejection for job opportunities because of their disability, and 34.4% because of their gender. Most working women, on the other hand, received no support on workplace accessibility and reasonable accommodation, and 44.7% of them did not receive equal pay for equal work. Over half of the informants reported personal income as lower than CNY 2000 per month. 36.3% of women surveyed in 2020 experienced loss of income due to COVID-19. 188 \nIn 2020, the CDPF, supported by UN ESCAP, UN Women, UNFPA, and Rehabilitation International, released a “ Call to Action: Enabling Sisters with Disabilities to Join in Shaping the Future We Want ” in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action at the Fourth World Conference on Women, and the fifth year of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Promoting adequate standard of living, health, and education of women and girls with disabilities are among the top of the list of call for actions. Sexual and reproductive health is considered a key entry point of intervention for women and LGBTI persons with disabilities by consulted stakeholders, which, in the context of China, connects cross-cutting issues of healthcare, education, employment, accessibility, anti-violence, and rights awareness raising for persons with disabilities. \n8. Disability Inclusion in Broader Development, Humanitarian & Emergency Contexts \n8.1 National Development Plans \nIn China ’s National Plan on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 189 disability was explicitly mentioned in China ’s action plan for goal 4 (quality education), 8 (decent work and economic growth), and 10 (reduced inequalities). Specifically, China ’s actions plans with explicit reference to disability include: \n• SDG 4.2: Improve the funding system for preschool education to help the less-privileged, such as children from needy families, orphans and children with disabilities, to gain access to public preschool education. Improve the quality of kindergarten teachers \n• SDG 4.5: Protect everyone ’s right including that of vulnerable groups to education, and improve special education. Open special education schools in counties with more than 300,000 residents and gradually ensure 12-year free education for children with disabilities, covering the 9-year compulsory education and the senior high school education. \n• SDG 8.5: Increase labor force participation rate through implementation of the classification policy. Vigorously enforce the Law on Promotion of Employment. Targeted measures have been formulated to promote employment of university graduates, migrant workers, people with disabilities, retired soldiers, women and some other groups. Improve employment and entrepreneurship services and launch a lifelong vocational training initiative.",
            "• SDG 8.10: Implement the Plan for Promoting the Development of Financial Inclusion(2016-2020) to establish, by 2020, an inclusive financial services and security system to increase the accessibility of timely, affordable, and convenient financial services for the general public, especially for small and micro enterprises, farmers, urban low-incomers, poor people, people with disabilities and the elderly. By 2020, establish a modern insurance industry that is comprehensive, stable, well-functioning and credible. \n• SDG 10.3: Establish a more equitable and sustainable social protection system that better protect rights and interests of vulnerable social groups such as women, minors, and people with disabilities. \nIn China ’s Progress Report on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2021), persons with disabilities were reported as beneficiaries of China ’s progress on SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG4 (quality education), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). 190 In China ’s 2021 Voluntary National Review, people with disabilities are mentioned as beneficiaries of China ’s efforts in SDG 1.5, the world ’s largest social security system, and COVID response. No specific evidence was provided regarding the implementation of the disability-related goals listed in China ’s Action Plan. 191 There is no reference to OPD participation or capacity development support of OPDs in the Action Plan, Progress Report, or Voluntary National Review. \nThe UNSDCF (2021-2025) with China included disability-related support in “ Outcome 2: People ’s lives in China are improved further as headway is made in ensuring access to childcare, education, healthcare services, elderly care, housing, and social assistance, and more people in China, including left-behind groups, benefit from equitable and high-quality public services and social protection systems as well as accelerated efforts to reduce gender inequality and other forms of social inequality throughout the lifecourse. ” 192 The UNTGD is fully consulted in the country plans and strategies, processes and reporting. Other bilateral agencies and donors promote and engage in disability rights through their participation in the UNTGD meetings and activities, but most from disability-specific rather than disability mainstreaming perspectives.",
            "Background \nPurpose of analysis \nThe UN Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (PRPD) is dedicated to the implementation of the CRPD, by bringing together different UN entities, governments, persons with disabilities and civil society for the purpose of joint programming and partnerships. To better support countries, the PRPD believes it is necessary to understand what the main bottlenecks and priorities are in each country in relation to the fulfilment of the CRPD. This Situational Analysis was developed as a requirement of the inception phase of the fourth call for proposals of the UNPRPD Multi-Partner Trust Fund (UNPRPD MPTF). Key objectives of the 4 th call include advancing CRPD implementation at country level by focusing on the preconditions for disability inclusion across sectors, and improving the implementation of disability inclusive SDGs at the country level. The main goal of the situational analysis is to inform the design of future cross-sector PRPD programs in China, with the report serving as a baseline. The analysis also aims to build working relationships between UN entities, government, OPDs, other civil society organizations, private sector and academia, as a basis for future co-design of programs; to strengthen the capacity of above stakeholders to include and address the rights of persons with disabilities more effectively; and to inspire disability inclusion adjustments in ongoing UN programs and processes. \nIntroduction to disability in China \nOfficially, China is home to 85 million persons with disabilities, roughly 6% of the total population. The most recent national survey on disability (2006) found that 17.8% of households in China had family members with disabilities. 75.04% of persons with disabilities resided in rural areas, 53.24% were above 60 years old, and 51.55% were men. 2 China ’s Law on the Protection of Disabled Persons (LPPD) defines a person with disabilities as “ one who has abnormalities of loss of a certain organ or function, psychologically or physiologically, or in anatomical structure and has lost wholly or in part the ability to perform an activity in the way considered normal. ” Based on this definition, six categories of disability are certified, including visual disabilities, hearing disabilities, physical disabilities, speech disabilities, intellectual disabilities, and psychiatric disabilities, with four grades under each category. By 2021, 38 million persons with disabilities held a disability certificate, among whom 22 million were men, and 30.1 million were registered as rural residents. 3 Among the disability certificate holders, 18.7% were illiterate, 40.3% received primary education, and 30.3% went to middle school. 4 \nThe China Disabled Persons Federation (CDPF), a semi-governmental mass organization with vice-ministry level status, was founded in 1988, marking significant national commitment to disability issues. 5 The CDPF ’s mission is to “ represent, serve, and manage ” persons with disabilities across China. 6 By 2018, a 4中国残疾人联合会.

            "1.3 Parent Organizations \nIt is debatable whether parent groups count as OPDs. In China, many parent groups self-identify as OPDs. Unlike other CSOs, they face similar barriers as OPDs, and are currently the main advocates for persons with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities. One Foundation, through their parent support programs, estimated that there were 162 parent organizations across China, mostly concentrated in capitals and first-tier cities. 24 In 2014, 17 parent groups and organizations across China formed a voluntary national network called Inclusion China, and by 2017 the network expanded to 69 members. 25 Another major network, Shenzhen Autism Society, for instance, has 116 member organizations as of 2023. 26 Total account of parent groups in China needs further research. \n1.4 Service providing organisations (CSOs and INGOs) \nGovernment-procured service providers: Across China, many registered CSOs provide medical or vocational rehabilitation, day care, social work, assistive technology, and other services for persons with disabilities in local communities. As of June 2020, China had more than 7,800 officially registered social organizations that provides service and support in the disability field. 27 OPD informants of this report note that most of these CSOs for persons with disabilities do not have staff with disabilities. \nPhilanthropic Foundations: According to a recent OPD report, 2,363 philanthropic foundations had disability-related components in their programs, 27.59% of the total number of foundations in China. Between 2016 and 2020, funding for disability programs in disability-related foundations increased from CNY 5.58 billion to CNY 11.5 billion. Most of these foundations concentrate in East and Southwest China, with a focus on persons with physical disabilities, prioritizing rehabilitation and assistive technology. 28 International NGOs (INGOs): INGOs used to play an active role in supporting disability programs in China, providing funding, capacity building, and technical assistance for domestic CSOs/OPDs. The 2016 Law on Administration of Activities of Overseas Nongovernmental Organisations significantly increased the threshold and administrative costs for INGOs to operate in China. Currently, a handful INGOs are still working on disability issues in China, including Humanity & Inclusion (formerly known as Handicap International), which works on emergency relief, access to education and employment, sexual and reproductive health, gender-based violence against women and girls with disabilities, and social inclusion; Save the Children, which focuses on inclusive education for children with disabilities; as well as the Asia Foundation, Special Olympics East Asia, Kadoorie Charitable Foundation, Marie Stopes International, and the Ford Foundation. \nCSO/INGO engagement with OPDs varies according to their funding source, mandate, and awareness of the social model of disability. A handful of CSOs with exposure to the CRPD and INGOs tend to consciously engage OPDs, yet consultation shows that grassroots OPDs are largely disconnected from most CSOs in China. To date, there is no single civil society platform for SDG implementation, nor are OPDs actively engaged in policy platforms for SDG (see Section 8.1).",
            "on, inequalities, and gender. For each area of inquiry, the analysis follows the research questions provided by the UNPRPD, in identifying the gaps and opportunities to inform future development programs. The analysis is primarily based on secondary literature review, supplemented with consultations, carried out between March 2023 and June 2023. \nEquality and Non-Discrimination: China has more than 80 laws and 50 administrative regulations directly related to the interests of persons with disabilities, and regularly updated its national strategy for disability since 1991. Translating these commitments into better inclusion requires efforts to better align disabilityrelated policies and laws with the social model of disability, meaningfully engage OPDs independent from the state in decision making, and fully implement accessibility, reasonable accommodations, and antidiscrimination provisions. Culturally, the charity or medical model of disability remains dominant in public attitudes. \nAccessibility: China has issued more than 450 regulations, rules and normative documents on accessibility implementation and management. In recent years, campaigns are carried out to improve access to information. A further welcoming development is the new Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, passed on June 28, 2023. The effects of these policies depend on strong enforcement, sufficient remedies, and the meaningful engagement of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessibility tools and rules, with considerations of diverse needs among marginalized communities, such as deaf people/persons with hearing impairments, persons with intellectual disabilities, and persons with psychosocial disabilities. \nInclusive Service Delivery: Among 85 million officially estimated persons with disabilities, 38 million (44.7%) hold a disability certificate as of 2021. The task for service provision is daunting given the huge and diverse demands, and China has reached impressive coverage of services, especially in social protection and rehabilitation. To better align with the CRPD, the next step is to shift the focus from welfare provision to social inclusion, from special needs to inclusive services. This would require better rights awareness, accessibility, and reasonable accommodations in mainstream services, such as health, education, and employment; stronger support for caregiving instead of demanding family responsibilities; and more equitable allocation of resources for marginalized communities, such as persons with disabilities in rural areas, persons with severe or multiple disabilities, women with disabilities, and persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: According to the Ministry of Finance, in 2021, the national public budget expenditure on disability affairs was CNY 70.6 billion, roughly 0.287% of the total national general public budget expenditure. Majority of the disability budget (43.3%) was spent on living and care subsidies. Inclusive services"

            "6.2 National accountability mechanisms \nOfficially, the State Council Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work is responsible for promoting the implementation of the CRPD. Information on the effectiveness of the Committee in mainstreaming CRPD across all sectors and levels of government is lacking. 160 There is no independent mechanism appointed to monitor the implementation of the CRPD. 161 \nThe CDPF is the focal point overseeing the implementation of the CRPD, responsible for monitoring whether the creation and implementation of policies and plans relating to the rights of persons with disabilities are consistent with the CRPD principles. Some CSOs were invited to consultations for CRPD reporting but OPDs were underrepresented. 162 Most CSOs involved were specialized associations funded by the CDPF, or service provision organizations led by people without disabilities. In 2018, the State Council Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work published China ’s draft CRPD country report for public opinions, but the time window was fewer than 24 hours, making it impractical for meaningful comments to be incorporated. 163 A few OPDs have engaged in CRPD monitoring through shadow reporting, but most OPDs consulted have not engaged in CRPD monitoring mechanisms. \nChina has completed its combined second and third periodic reports. The review sessions concluded in September 2022. Major findings of the concluding observations suggest that China ’s disability-related policies and laws are not yet fully aligned with the social model of disability, OPDs independent from the state lack meaningful participation in policy-making, and China ’s legal system lacks anti-discrimination frameworks and effective provisions guaranteeing reasonable accommodations. 164 \nIn China ’s National Plan on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 165 disability was explicitly mentioned in China ’s action plan for goal 4 (quality education), 8 (decent work and economic growth), and 10 (reduced inequalities).

By the end of 2020, the enrollment rate of children with disabilities in compulsory education exceeded 95%; a total of 880,800 special education students had been enrolled, 388,800 more than in 2016. ” \n• “ From 2016 to 2020, 1.81 million people with disabilities got employed in urban and rural areas. As of the end of 2020, 2.39 million people with disabilities obtained flexible employment (including community and home employment). ” 167 \nIn China ’s 2021 Voluntary National Review, people with disabilities are mentioned as beneficiaries of China ’s efforts in SDG 1.5, the world ’s largest social security system, and COVID response.

This Situational Analysis provides an overview of the five preconditions for disability inclusion, as defined by the United Nations Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNPRPD) — equality and non-discrimination, inclusive service delivery, accessibility, CRPD compliant budgeting, and accountability and governance; and three cross-cutting issues including participation, inequalities, and gender. For each area of inquiry, the analysis follows the research questions provided by the UNPRPD, in identifying the gaps and opportunities to inform future development programs. The analysis is primarily based on secondary literature review, supplemented with consultations, carried out between March 2023 and June 2023. \nEquality and Non-Discrimination: China has more than 80 laws and 50 administrative regulations directly related to the interests of persons with disabilities, and regularly updated its national strategy for disability since 1991. Translating these commitments into better inclusion requires efforts to better align disabilityrelated policies and laws with the social model of disability, meaningfully engage OPDs independent from the state in decision making, and fully implement accessibility, reasonable accommodations, and antidiscrimination provisions. Culturally, the charity or medical model of disability remains dominant in public attitudes. \nAccessibility: China has issued more than 450 regulations, rules and normative documents on accessibility implementation and management. In recent years, campaigns are carried out to improve access to information. A further welcoming development is the new Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, passed on June 28, 2023. The effects of these policies depend on strong enforcement, sufficient remedies, and the meaningful engagement of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessibility tools and rules, with considerations of diverse needs among marginalized communities, such as deaf people/persons with hearing impairments, persons with intellectual disabilities, and persons with psychosocial disabilities. \nInclusive Service Delivery: Among 85 million officially estimated persons with disabilities, 38 million (44.7%) hold a disability certificate as of 2021. The task for service provision is daunting given the huge and diverse demands, and China has reached impressive coverage of services, especially in social protection and rehabilitation. To better align with the CRPD, the next step is to shift the focus from welfare provision to social inclusion, from special needs to inclusive services. This would require better rights awareness, accessibility, and reasonable accommodations in mainstream services, such as health, education, and employment; stronger support for caregiving instead of demanding family responsibilities; and more equitable allocation of resources for marginalized communities, such as persons with disabilities in rural areas, persons with severe or multiple disabilities, women with disabilities, and persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: According to the Ministry of Finance, in 2021, the national public budget expenditure on disability affairs was CNY 70.6 billion, roughly 0.287% of the total national general public budget expenditure. Majority of the disability budget (43.3%) was spent on living and care subsidies. Inclusive services such as inclusive education and employment, as championed by the CRPD, need stronger financial support. \nAccountability and governance: The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recommends an independent mechanism appointed to monitor the implementation of the CRPD. The CDPF regularly collects data from disability certificate holders and publishes annual updates in its key mandates, yet the data is not specifically aligned with the definition of disability or priority areas of the CRPD or SDGs. Data disaggregated by disability in mainstream statistical efforts need enhancement.",
            "onal Plan on New Urbanization (2014 –2020). National accessibility standards (GB 50763-2012) have also been adopted. Comprehensive data about the application of the technical standards are unavailable and should be addressed by future research. Accessibility is not yet mainstreamed into public procurement, according to government informants consulted. \nIn recent years, more attention has been paid to the accessibility of information and communications. In 2020, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and CDPF issued the Guiding Opinions on Promoting Information Accessibility, focusing on removing barriers of the affordability, devices, and services of information for persons with disabilities. 45 On 5 February 2022, China ratified the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled. In 2021, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology launched a whole year Action Plan to modify the accessibility of internet applications for elderly people and persons with disabilities, mitigating “ digital divides. ” 46 The Action Plan explicitly listed 158 websites and applications targeted for modification, ranging from those of governments, news outlets, airlines and railways, social media, and e-commerce, to search engines, banks, travel agencies, health services. By 2022, over 800 government entities modified their web accessibility, 320 websites passed an accessibility audit, and nearly 100 applications added accessibility features such as large fonts, high contrast, and easy to read pages. 47 The provision of accessible services such as sign language interpretation are mentioned in the Rule on the Construction of Accessible Environment, Guiding Opinions on Strengthening the Construction of Broadcasting and Television Public Service System, and National Basic Public Service Standards. China has also issued its Second National Sign Language and Braille Standardization Action Plan (2021-2025), and the Promotion Plan for National Universal Sign Language. \nIn 2022, the draft Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments solicited public opinions. The second draft was released for public comments in April 2023. The legislation is widely recognized as a "

            "3.2 Key Gaps in Accessibility \nBuilt Environment \nDespite increased policy commitment and investment, barriers in built environment remain. Data on the budgeting and monitoring of accessibility are not consistently available. According to a 2017 national survey conducted by China Consumer Society and CDPF, the overall coverage of barrier-free facilities (including accessible exits and entrances, elevators, wheelchair accessible bathrooms, and sign language proficiency among staff) in Chinese cities was 40.6%, among which hospitals had the highest coverage (67.4%) and commercial areas were the lowest (31.2%). Among existing barrier-free facilities, many were unavailable, occupied, under-maintained, and poorly designed. Public satisfaction rate for accessibility was also low. The survey shows barriers including technical challenges in architectural modification, lack of government coordination, lack of business incentives, and discriminatory attitudes towards consumers with disabilities. 55 \nInformal monitoring by OPDs also exist. For instance, a survey of over 600 travelers with disabilities shows that the top five barriers that persons with disabilities face when traveling are lack of accessible facilities (61.7%), unavailability of information about accessibility (46.4%), inaccessible hotels and transportation (41.9%), lack of accessible services (27.2%), and negative attitudes by service providers (18.8%). 56 The lack of barrier-free facilities not only impedes equal participation of persons with disabilities in society but also poses threats to the personal safety of persons with disabilities, as revealed by two incidents caused by poor accessibility leading to the deaths of two activists with disabilities. 57 58 The gaps further widen in rural areas. 59",
            "OPDs consulted for the report identified the following key gaps in accessibility as the most urgent: low public awareness of accessibility, weak enforcement of laws and standards, and the lack of participation of persons with disabilities in designing, monitoring, and evaluating accessibility. Expert informants note that enforcement of accessibility policies requires strong inter-ministerial coordination, which DPFs lack sufficient authority for. Awareness of local government leadership and the support of more powerful ministries is crucial. OPDs are also calling for strengthening the digital literacy of persons with disabilities, which is positively correlated with income levels in China. 64 A CDPF joined study found that due to lack of internet access or devices, prohibition by parents, and insufficient skills to use accessibility features, the usage rate of internet among youth with disabilities (aged 10-18) is merely 68%, significantly lower than youth without disabilities (94.9%). 65 While digital tools are important means of production, there lacks systemic assessment of the digital literacy of persons with disabilities. \n4. Inclusive Service Delivery \n4.1 Disability assessment and referral systems \nChina ’s current disability determination system does not align with the CRPD ’s social model definition of disability, or the WHO classification system. The Classification and Grading Criteria for Disability (GB/T 26341-2010) provides national standards for six types of disability, namely visual impairment/blind, Hearing impairment/deaf, Physical disability, Speech disability, Intellectual disability, and Psychiatric disabilities, with four grades under each type. Legal determination of disability is conducted by designated medical institutions, and the recognition of disability comes in the form of a certificate issued by the CDPF, which is a prerequisite for applying for disability subsidies and functions as an identification to access a range of benefits and services. Early i dentification and intervention mechanisms for children aged 0-6 are promoted by the N ational Disability Prevention Action Plan (2021-2025) and the Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities (2017). In 2021, 278,695 children with disabilities received basic rehabilitation services nationwide. 66 Quality of the services, disaggregated by type of disability, location, and gender, needs further assessment. \nPredominantly based on biomedical criteria, the system does not account for the social and environmental factors that affect people ’s capacity to undertake activities of daily life and participation. The determination criteria also prioritize people who could not recover after receiving treatment for over a year, and does not account for temporary impairments. 67 \nThe DPFs regularly update and monitor data of certified persons with disabilities, as basis for service provision and policy making. Among 85 million officially estimated persons with disabilities, only 38 million (44.7%) hold a disability certificate as of 2021, and 57.8% of them are men. 68 The low rate of certificate holding is in part due to stigma, lack of information, inaccessibility of the determination system, and 68中国残疾人联合会. (2021). 3-2全国持证残疾人人口基础库主要数据. \nmismatch with the official criteria. 69 Persons with disabilities can make complaints through the government service hotlines or petitioning (xinfang) reception system/staff/office of local governments and DPFs.",
            "Access to justice \nAccording to a UNDP China report on Equal Access to Justice for Persons with Disabilities, 142 persons with disabilities face significant challenges in accessing the justice system. These include: \n• “ Limited legal knowledge. \n• Unaffordability of current legal services, and the general lack of knowledge about free legal aid services. \n• For persons with [psychosocial] and intellectual disabilities and others who are placed under adult guardianship, their legal capacity is restricted. \n• In the process of providing criminal legal aid for persons with visual, hearing, speech and mental impairments, there is a lack of effective and timely support in communication and information accessibility. \n• For persons with physical or visual impairments, if and when they face discrimination in the realms of transportation, education and employment, they cannot resort to the judicial system for equality. \n• Women with disabilities are more vulnerable to rights infringement and have less access to justice. \n• Continuous social discrimination and prejudice that all [persons with disabilities] face critically restricts their ability to navigate the judicial system effectively in order to realize their human rights and also undermines their confidence and adds to their already existing dismay. ” The report concludes that the key to improving equal access to justice is greater accessibility support and reasonable accommodations throughout the judicial process. \nParticipation in public and political life China is not short of policies and laws that protect the political participation right of persons with disabilities on paper. The 2008 LPPD stipulates that “ Persons with disabilities shall enjoy equal rights with other citizens in political, economic, cultural and social respects and in family life as well ” (Article 3) and that “ competent departments in charge of the organization of elections shall facilitate persons with disabilities to vote in elections. Braille ballots shall be available wherever possible ” (Article 56). 143 Mechanisms for participating in public and political life for persons with disabilities in China include taking",
            "2.2 Barriers to Equity \nThe Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities observed systemic barriers to the inclusion of persons with disabilities in China, including that 43 : \n• disability-related policies and laws do not fully align with the social model of disability; \n• OPDs independent from the state are not meaningfully included in policy-making; \n• anti-discrimination and reasonable accommodations are not legally guaranteed or fully implemented; \n• there are limited mechanisms in preventing violence, trafficking, forced marriage, neglect, or abandonment of women and children with disabilities; \n• substitute decision-making regime persists to deny or restricts adults with disabilities in their legal capacity to act; \n• lack of procedural accommodation, accessible information, and inaccessible buildings impedes disabled persons ’ access to justice; \n• discriminatory provisions in the LPPD allow for coercive institutionalization and treatment of persons with psychosocial disabilities; \n• accessibility regulations and standards are insufficiently enforced; \n• the state pressures on and censors rights-based advocacy; \n• segregated special education remains the norm and mainstream schools lack support regarding inclusive education; \n• the right to freely choose occupations and access to just and favourable conditions of work is lacking; \n• and legal restrictions to disabled persons ’ political participation still persists. \nAmong these barriers, consultations for this report identified the social prejudice and discrimination against persons with disabilities as the most fundamental. Debates between the “ welfare ” approach and the “ rights ” approach to disability remain among policy and law makers. Specific barriers in domains such as accessibility, education, and employment will be addressed in detail in Section 3 and Section 4. \n3. Accessibility \n3.1 Legislative and policy context",
            "Health \nGeneral healthcare \nChina ’s mainstream health policies and strategies predominantly regards disability as a target for prevention and clinical rehabilitation. The Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities (2017), the 14 th Five-year Plan on disability, 97 and the National Disability Prevention Action Plan (2021-2025), 98 all define preventing disability as specific health targets. The Healthy China 2030 Plan re-emphasizes the rehabilitation and prevention of disabilities, with a provision on “ enhancing the accessibility of medical institutions, and improving medical services for people with disabilities. ” 99 Some hospitals do provide accessible volunteer services, especially for persons with hearing or visual impairments. Consultations for this report reveal that mainstream medical system remain largely inaccessible, or unaffordable for certain communities of persons with rare diseases, and adopts a strong medical model of disability that fails to connect the patients ’ medical needs with social services. \nAccess to general healthcare is uneven. A recent analysis based on data from the National Survey on Basic Public Service Delivery of Persons with Disabilities revealed high rate of unmet healthcare needs. 15.4% of persons with disabilities lacked regular medical care when ill, and 45.6% reported needing more targeted rehabilitation services than they had. Rural residents were 13-40% more likely to lack healthcare, which was in part the result of the unequal access to health facilities, social participation, and health professionals at the community level. Among the respondents, persons with multiple disabilities experienced the highest levels of overall unmet healthcare needs, and people with physical disabilities had more unmet needs in rehabilitation. 100 Further, among China ’s over five million children with disabilities, 63% did not receive adequate healthcare, due to poor information, shortage of services, and affordability. 101 General health data disaggregated by disability, such as evidence of inequalities in health faced by persons with disabilities (corresponds to the OHCHR CRPD-SDG indicators) are not available. \nSexual and Reproductive Health and Rights Women with disabilities face additional barriers in accessing healthcare, especially sexual and reproductive health (SRH). 102 Women and youth with disabilities face higher risks of sexual violence, forced abortion, contraception and sterilization, financial and other forms of control, 103 yet they have limited access to SRH information and services. 104 In a UNESCO China and Humanity & Inclusion study, less than 20% young persons with disabilities in both urban and rural areas reported having counselling, referral services, or free contraceptives in their schools or communities. 105 A study co-funded by the CDPF \n105 Ibid. \nand State Council Committee on Women and Children ’s Work revealed large gaps in disabled women ’s access to healthcare and rehabilitation services. For instance, in Heilongjiang province, merely 50.2% women with disabilities received prenatal check during their last childbirth, 20.4 percentage points lower than women in general. Women with disabilities in rural areas had an even lower prenatal checking rate of 36.2%, and were significantly less likely (46.7 percentage points less) than urban women with disabilities to receive in-hospital child delivery care, indicating sharp disparity between urban and rural service provision. 106 Women with disabilities in poor households also experience higher prevalence of SRH related diseases. 107 An 2015 study tested the SRH knowledge of 248 women with disabilities, and the correction rate was 45.14%. 108 In response, UNESCO, UNFPA, Marie Stopes International, and Youren Foundation have conducted comprehensive sexuality education for persons with disabilities.",
            "cially among development partners and OPDs/CSOs. Yet the Chinese society at large and its corresponding systems are predominantly taking a medical model approach to disability, regarding persons with disabilities as subjects of charity and welfare in need of special rather than mainstream services. Policy makers and service providers, especially at grassroots levels, lack the awareness and buy-in of CRPD or the social model of disability. Laws and regulations relevant to disability are not fully aligned with the CRPD, and lack strength in enforcement and remedies. \nInclusive Service Delivery: The current policy frameworks tend to regard persons with disabilities as welfare beneficiaries more than rights holders. Public provision of disability support services prioritize social protection, subsidies, and rehabilitation, less focused on building support systems for the equal participation of persons with disabilities in society, such as inclusive education and employment. Policy makers are incentivized to maximize service coverage for the large population of persons with disabilities with limited resources, de-emphasizing the quality of services. The agency and autonomy of persons with disabilities is downplayed. As reflected in multi-stakeholder consultations, OPDs are concerned about the policy focus on family ’s responsibility in caregiving for persons with disabilities, without sufficient government support. \nAccessibility: Unchecked discrimination against persons with disabilities, combined with the lack of reasonable accommodations and accessibility, pose consistent barriers in all aspects of social participation of persons with disabilities. Despite increased government investment in accessibility, weak enforcement, insufficient remedies, and the lack of meaningful participation of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessible tools and standards has resulted in the poor quality of accessibility measures. As shown in the draft Law on the Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, there is also a tendency to prioritize physical environment over access to information and service provision, especially for persons with intellectual or psychosocial impairments, and deaf people/persons with hearing impairments. \nAccountability and Governance: Disability has not yet been mainstreamed into the current governance structure. The CDPF system is assigned the responsibility for disability inclusion but with insufficient authority to coordinate with other ministries. This relatively segregated coordination mechanism within the government, according to stakeholders consulted, can form barriers for OPDs to engage mainstream ministries and obtain resources from the government which are concentrated within the DPF system. Consistent data collections on disability inclusion aligned with the CRPD and SDGs are lacking. Official statistics on disability adopt impairment-based definitions of disability and does not comply with the ICF or CRPD definitions of disability. Further, stakeholders are concerned about the reliability of self-reported data, the transparency of data, and the lack of disaggregated data by disability in mainstream data collections. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: Despite the much larger size compared to development partners, government budgeting prioritizes welfare provision over rights protection, and special rather than mainstream services.

            "China ’s ageing population has made the provision of accessible environment and services ever more urgent. COVID-19 also heightened the issue of digital divide in China, making it pressing for improving the digital accessibility and digital literacy among persons with disabilities and elderly people. The new Law on the Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, passed on June 28, 2023, is indicative of the growing importance of accessibility in recent years, and creates a policy window for more awareness-raising on accessibility, including built environment, information and communication, and services. Although the second draft of the law is still criticized for having “ no teeth ” or remedies, its symbolic presence can boost the legitimacy of local OPDs ’ existing efforts in requesting access with public service providers (e.g. subway, banks, etc.). Government stakeholders also foresee needs for technical and publicity support on promoting the new legislation and specifying local-level enforcement measures. In addition, policies like the 2021 Special Action Plan on Elderly-oriented and Barrier-free Modifications for Internet Applications, the 2021 Action Plan on Improving National Digital Literacy and Skills, and China ’s entry into the Marrakesh Treaty, create incentives for more stakeholders to engage in accessibility. To take advantage of these developments, OPDs call for attention to the digital literacy divide caused by lack of access to digital tools or skills. \nChina ’s population policies have been undergoing transformations in recent years. Since 2021, couples in China are allowed to have three children with support measures. 206 In 2022, China witnessed its first population decline in 60 years. 207 While family planning policies continue to relax and policy incentives for child-rearing increase, the implications for persons with disabilities are unclear. On one hand, persons with disabilities lack equal access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) care; on the other hand, preventing disability remains a health target in national health strategies. 208 To maximize the benefits and minimize the harm of the increased investment in population growth and health management, the SRH needs of persons with disabilities warrant attention. Meanwhile, SRH offers an entry-point for persons with disabilities to address cross-cutting issues such as gender-based violence, education and health inequity, and the agency and autonomy of individuals with disabilities. \nA potential mechanism to expand OPD participation in decision-making is to take part in research that can serve as evidence for policy making. This is in line with the Communist Party ’s recent promotion for research and survey among Party members to better connect policy and practice. 209 Best practices include OPDs organizing community focus groups and partnering with scholars involved in policy making to submit proposals or policy opinions; combining short-term trainings with long-term regular research groups; and co-authoring independent surveys/study reports with subject matter experts. \nA gradual cultural shift is taking place from the medical model to the social model. More self-advocates with disabilities and new narratives are emerging in mainstream and social media, challenging stereotypes about disability. These circumstances present a crucial opportunity for the UN to leverage its influence, such as advocating for policy changes that align with the CRPD, building capacity and providing platforms for OPDs and individual advocates, and support the government, including CDPF and other ministries, in promoting inclusive services.",

            "7. To establish meaningful mechanisms to enhance OPD participation and amplify the voices of persons with disabilities in UN supported programmes. For instance, within the UNPRPD program, pilot test a mechanism for OPDs to partner with scholars/CSOs/think tanks/associations on evidence-based policy advocacy. The latter stakeholders can function as intermediaries between grassroots OPDs and policy makers. The collaboration mechanism should combine OPDs ’ disability-specific expertise, with the allies ’ domain-specific expertise and government access (e.g. education, health/SRHR, employment, or accessibility), and produce joint products for policy advocacy (e.g. reports, policy proposals, internal briefings, or pilot programs). The mechanism should fully leverage OPDs ’ leadership and expertise in analyzing community needs, while strengthening OPDs ’ policy advocacy skills and local-level support networks. It should also serve to increase the disability inclusion awareness and capabilities of domain experts. OPDs shall play a leading role in the mechanism, with sufficient decision-making power at each stage of the project, rather than mere data collectors. The UN should aim for creating opportunities for de-bureaucratized, informal engagement among stakeholders. \n8. To strengthen the resources and capacity for grassroots OPDs to participate in policy making, implementation, and monitoring in UN funded programmes. This could serve as models of good practice for other local programmes. Leverage the UNPRPD program and platforms such as the UNTGD, to facilitate regular knowledge exchanges among OPDs and stakeholders on successful engagement with existing participation mechanisms. These can include best practices of partnering with governmenttrusted think tanks for policy advocacy, submitting proposals to the NPC and CPPCC sessions, engagement strategies with government entities, campaigns for mobilizing public comments on draft legislations, monitoring the implementation of accessibility standards, participation in UN human rights treaty mechanisms, and effective collaboration with the private sector. The UN should provide a safe space and allocate sufficient resources to ensure OPDs and individuals with disabilities with less access can benefit. \n9. To create platforms for capacity building and international exchange for grassroots OPDs. Although development funding is negligible compared to the scale of government budget on disability, resources for OPDs remain scarce. OPDs operating in similar social and economic contexts can share ideas and build peer-support networks. It can also increase the visibility of Chinese OPDs at the international level and share Chinese best practices with other countries. \n10. To prioritize women with disabilities and marginalized communities in the design of the PRPD program. Prioritize the leadership of women with disabilities in development programs, and support gender-sensitive approaches to disability programs, rather than merely including female participants in activities. Allocate sufficient financial and human resources to support the meaningful participation of marginalized communities, such as travel, lodging, personal assistance, and reasonable accommodations. \n11. To enhance disability and gender mutual mainstreaming within the UN system. The 2022 Disability Inclusion Scorecard Assessment shows that the UNCT still fall short in meeting Indicator 8 “ Joint programmes: Joint programmes contribute to disability inclusion ” and Indicator 9 “ Data: Strengthening data on persons with disabilities. ” OPDs expect the UN to further implement the United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy, and model best practices such as incorporating disability components, indicators, and OPDs in non-disability focused UN programs, employing persons with disabilities, enhancing the accessibility of UN offices and meetings, and increasing the collection and disclosure of data disaggregated by types of disability, degrees of disability, and location of persons with disabilities. \nwww.UNPRPD.org",
            "1.5 International Cooperation (UN Agencies, Donors) \nUNPRPD China Programme was implemented from 2014 to 2020. As a result of the Programme, the UN Country Team in China formed and institutionalized the UN Theme Group on Disability (UNTGD), a comprehensive, multi-stakeholder platform composing of over 100 key stakeholders for open dialogue and advocacy on the needs and rights of persons with disabilities in China. The UNTGD aims to consolidate the efforts and foster consultation and collaboration of its members including UN agencies and external disability stakeholders, in supporting the government in fulfilling its commitments to the CRPD and in achieving national goals on ensuring the equal rights of persons with disabilities. \nThe UNTGD is positioned to support the effective implementation of UN ’s collective commitments and actions in the new UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF), and to strengthen the UN ’s accountability towards disability inclusion in response to the Disability Inclusion Scorecard. The UNRCO and all UN agencies have respectively assigned a disability focal point as UNTGD member. The following agencies are especially engaging in advancing the rights of persons with disabilities with specific focuses relevant to their respective mandates: \n• UNESCO: inclusive education, information accessibility, promotion of disability inclusion through and in media and culture, media and information as well as digital literacy \n• UNICEF: inclusive education, accessible and child-friendly environment, social protection for children with disabilities, inclusive child welfare and protection services, public awareness raising and advocacy on disability inclusion. \n• UNFPA: strengthen universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) and GBV information and services, and advocate disability data generation \n• UNDP: access to justice for persons with disabilities \n• ILO: employment and decent work for persons with disabilities \n• UN Women: Research on gender gaps between men with disabilities and women with disabilities and support the advocacy of the rights of women and girls with disabilities \nNo other UN agencies ’ joint programs supporting legislative reforms, policy development or other relevant national programs that are important for persons with disabilities are available. \nThe knowledge and understanding of UN agencies staff on disability inclusive programming have been gradually enhanced in recent years, especially among the staff members from the agencies that are closely involved in the capacity building activities and joint programmes and activities on disability inclusion. Key trainings include: a half-day meeting and discussion on disability equality for UN staff held on 1 August 2018, participated by 18 UN colleagues from 10 UN agencies; a Disability Equality Training workshop for UNCT held in 2019 to strengthen the UNCT ’s capacity to ensure a human rights-based approach to disability is reflected in their work at all times, participated by 16 representatives from six UN agencies; a knowledge sharing session at the regular meeting of the UN Communications Group in China on media communications for promoting disability equality in China held in 2021, participated by communication officers from 20 UN agencies; and the six-day Induction workshop held under the UNPRPD 4th Funding Call Inception Phase in November-December 2022, participated by six colleagues representing 5 UN agencies, including UNESCO, ILO, UNFPA, WHO, UN Women and FAO.",
            "Approach \nGuiding principles \nTaking a rights-based approach rooted in the CRPD, this report follows the UNPRPD ’s framework of five preconditions for disability inclusion, namely, equality and non-discrimination, inclusive service delivery, accessibility, CRPD compliant budgeting, and accountability and governance; and three cross-cutting issues including participation, inequalities, and gender. \nThe research team follows the principle “ nothing about us without us ” in the design, implementation, and consultations of the situational analysis, ensuring the direct involvement of national and local organizations of persons with disabilities (OPDs), unofficial self-help groups of persons with disabilities, as well as individuals with disabilities. The core research team consists of members of a national OPD and an individual consultant in close coordination with the UNPRPD Taskforce in China, comprised of UNESCO, ILO, UNFPA, UN Women, and WHO. \nDespite time constraints, the research team strived to leverage the analysis as an opportunity to enhance relationships with and among stakeholders, bringing together government stakeholders, UNCT, and OPD leaders since the work plan design phase. Drafts of the report were sent to the UNCT, key government stakeholders, and OPDs for review, to ensure they are informed and involved in the analysis process. \nMethodology \nThis report followed the research questions listed in the “ UN PRPD guidance for conducting a situational country analysis of the rights of persons with disabilities. ” The analysis took place from March 2023 to June 2023. Due to the condensed timeframe of the analysis and the richness of existing literature, the analysis is primarily based on desk review of secondary literature and data, supplemented with key informant interviews, focus group discussions, an OPD preparatory workshop, and a multi-stakeholder consultation. \nFor desk research, the analysis draws comprehensively from existing literature on the preconditions of inclusion in China, ranging from the CRPD reviews, issue-based UN publications, government documents, official database and publications of the CDPF, articles published by OPDs, media reports, as well as Chinese and English language academic research. \nConsultations for the analysis focused on questions under-addressed by existing literature. Depending on stakeholders ’ accessibility preferences and availability, a mixture of consultation methods were adopted. The research team consulted in total 70 informants through in-person/online interviews, email questionnaires, focus group discussions, meetings, and soliciting written feedback and evidence. Email questionnaires and interviews were conducted with 33 OPDs, among which 42% of are unregistered grassroots groups, located in 18 different cities, working on promoting the rights of persons with physical, visual, intellectual, psychosocial, hearing, or multiple impairments, people with rare diseases, gender, and cross-disability issues. The team also interviewed and/or organized focus group discussions with 4 civil society organizations, and 5 government institutions, including the Education and Employment Department, Rights Protection Department, and Organizational and Liaison Department of the China Disabled Persons ’ Federation. Further, the research team reached out to 22 experts with domain-specific questions through written or online interviews, including scholars, lawyers, and UN agencies, among whom 6 are persons with disabilities. The draft report went through comprehensive reviews by 3 external experts, representing the perspectives of OPDs, policy makers, and development partners, with specializations in law, education, and OPD development. List of consulted stakeholders is not provided for protection of anonymity.",
            "The situation and rights of persons with disabilities is incorporated into the Common Country Analysis, UNSDCF and Joint Work Plans in full consultation with the UNTGD. As a result, the UNSDCF 2021-2025 has integrated disability inclusion by setting the commitment to “ leaving no one behind ” as one of its guiding principles and explicitly identifying persons with disabilities as one o f the groups more at risk of being left behind in China. Persons with disability are particularly referenced in parts related to rehabilitation services, full social inclusion, development, and legitimate rights and interests. Besides, UNSDCF also specifically stipulates that the participation of CDPF in the review and implementation of the UNSDCF will be made at the level of the Results Groups. \nSpecifically, under the UNSDCF Strategic Priority 1 “ People and Prosperity: Achieving innovation-driven, coordinated and shared development ”, Outcome 2 reads, “ People ’s lives in China are improved further as headways is made in ensuring access to childcare, education, healthcare services, elderly care, housing, and social assistance, and more people in China, including left-behind groups, benefit from equitable and high quality public services and social protection systems as well as accelerated efforts to reduced gender inequality and other forms of social inequality throughout the life-course. ” \nThe UN makes an effort to engage persons with disabilities and their representative organizations closely across ongoing programs at country level. One attempt was to make the UN premises more accessible. An assessment on the accessibility of the physical environment and services of all UN premises in China has been completed with support of the Accessibility Development Institute of Tsinghua University in 2021, with detailed recommendations provided for improvement. \nUNTGD provides a platform for international development partners to engage with OPDs. Currently, a few bilateral and multilateral donors such as the European Commission and British Council still have programs on disability. However, consultations show that international cooperation is increasingly scrutinized by authorities, and OPDs and local stakeholders are cautious about such engagement. \n1.6 Other Key Stakeholders (Academic, Private sector): Academic institutions or think tanks play an important role in the sector, due to their access to policy making channels. However, not all academics are aligned with the CRPD. OPDs are concerned that some academic institutions regard disability as an object of research but do not meaningfully engage OPDs, displacing rather than amplifying the voices of persons with disabilities. \nPrivate sector is increasingly active in disability inclusion, due to shifting funding structure for OPDs/CSOs, domestic policy incentives for disability-inclusive employment and services, and global corporate cultural change towards Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), and corporate social responsibility (CSR). A few social enterprises have been active in engaging the private sector. However, balancing the interests of business clients and the disability community is a challenge, which needs to involve different stakeholders, including government, disability advocates, and businesses themselves. A missed opportunity identified by informants is the lack of engagement with OPDs, reinforcing the fragmentation of limited resources of the field. Further, most businesses still lack the awareness of the social model of disability, taking a charity-based or tokenistic approach.",
            "to use materials, tools and communication methods that help to raise the awareness and capacity of OPDs on SRHR advocacy and the awareness and capacity of service providers to deliver better availability, accessibility, acceptance and quality of services. Use SRH as an entry point to enhance the mutual mainstreaming of disability and gender programs, and strengthen the safety, agency, life opportunities, and autonomy of women and girls with disabilities. \n5. To enhance coordination between stakeholders by strengthening UNCT partnerships with not only the DPFs but also other ministries, especially at the local level. Utilize the UN ’s convening power to engage ministries and departments, breaking the silos between DPFs, OPDs, and different government departments. Engage grassroots OPDs, local government departments and DPFs. This can help strengthen their coordination at the local levels, build support networks for local OPDs, and localize CRPD implementation in ways that account for local realities. The CDPF also conveyed some local DPFs ’ interests for international cooperation. \n6. To enhance the knowledge base of UNCT and national stakeholders on disability inclusion, in line with the CRPD to better understand gaps and opportunities. This will be used to inform future action. This analysis has identified a few areas that need further research by the UNCT, including: \n• The development of independent OPDs across China, especially in smaller cities/rural areas \n• Effectiveness of formal and informal participation mechanisms for state and non-state affiliated OPDs \n• The economic impact of inclusive education and employment of persons with disabilities on individual, family and"

            "part in voting and elections, joining representative bodies such as all levels of NPC and CPPCC, or working for state organs. There is no specific quota for persons with disabilities in the People ’s Congresses or Political Consultation Parties. In 2020, DPFs assisted 735 policy recommendations by people ’s congress and political consultation party delegates, and handled 1109 cases of their recommendations. 144 In practice, the lack of reasonable accommodations in political processes, the restrictions posed by mandatory public servant medical examinations, the tokenization of government employment quota, the preference for people with less severe disabilities, discriminatory social attitudes, and inadequate access to equal education, all contribute to the low rate of political participation of persons with disabilities. 145 Among persons with disabilities working at state institutions, persons with physical disabilities, and those with less severe disabilities are preferred. As of 2018, among local DPFs, 69.3% of municipal-level DPFs and 49.8% of county-level DPFs had staff members with disabilities. 146 As a step forward, in 2021, CDPF and four other ministries and departments issued a policy guidance regarding employing persons with disabilities in state organs, public institutions, and state-owned enterprises, explicitly requiring public sector employers to reasonably define the physical exam requirements for candidates with disabilities, and must not judge the candidates ’ health on the basis of their disability. 147 \n5. CRPD-compliant budgeting and financial management \nThere are three main mechanisms for the Chinese government to fund disability-related programs: regular public budget, special subsidy, and disability employment security fund (DESF). 148 From 2013 to 2017, the fiscal allocations from all levels of the government for persons with disabilities added up to over CNY 180 billion. 149 In 2021, the national public budget expenditure on disability affairs was CNY 70.6 billion, taking up 0.287% of the total national general public budget expenditure (24567.3 billion). 150 Compared to the scale of Chinese government budget (50-70 billion CNY per year), budgets of ongoing national development and humanitarian programs funded by international development partners are negligible. \nThe expenditures on disability affairs in 2021 included 30.6 billion on living and care subsidies (43.3%), 7.2 billion on rehabilitation, 6.6 billion on employment and poverty reduction, 5.5 billion on administrative costs, and 18.8 billion categorized as other expenditures. 151 In addition, CNY 16.1 billion of national public budget was spent on special education, 0.43% of the total education expenditures (3746.9 billion). 152 Article 48 of the 2017 Regulations on the Education of Persons with Disabilities stipulates that “ the financial funds allocated for compulsory education by local people ’s governments at all levels, as well as extra charges for education collected by these governments, shall have a certain proportion set aside for compulsory education for children and adolescents with disabilities. ” 153 Yet the proportion is not specified. \n146于娣.(2020).中国特色残联组织功能研究(博士学位论文,武汉理工大学). \nMost funding allocated for educating persons with disabilities are spent on special schools, and inclusive education in regular schools lacks financial support. 154 In 2021, The Action Plan for Special Education Development (2021-2025), issued in 2022 by the MOE, intends to increase the average government expenditure on compulsory education for children with disabilities from 6,000 yuan per student now to 7,000 yuan by 2025. 155",
            "2023 marks the 15 th year since China has ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2008. The landscape of disability inclusion in China has been undergoing deep transformation. This Situational Analysis provides an overview of the five preconditions for disability inclusion, as defined by the United Nations Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNPRPD) — equality and non-discrimination, inclusive service delivery, accessibility, CRPD compliant budgeting, and accountability and governance; and three cross-cutting issues including participation, inequalities, and gender. For each area of inquiry, the analysis follows the research questions provided by the UNPRPD, in identifying the gaps and opportunities to inform future development programs. The analysis is primarily based on secondary literature review, supplemented with consultations, carried out between March 2023 and June 2023. \nEquality and Non-Discrimination: China has more than 80 laws and 50 administrative regulations directly related to the interests of persons with disabilities, and regularly updated its national strategy for disability since 1991. Translating these commitments into better inclusion requires efforts to better align disabilityrelated policies and laws with the social model of disability, meaningfully engage OPDs independent from the state in decision making, and fully implement accessibility, reasonable accommodations, and antidiscrimination provisions. Culturally, the charity or medical model of disability remains dominant in public attitudes. \nAccessibility: China has issued more than 450 regulations, rules and normative documents on accessibility implementation and management. In recent years, campaigns are carried out to improve access to information. A further welcoming development is the new Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, passed on June 28, 2023. The effects of these policies depend on strong enforcement, sufficient remedies, and the meaningful engagement of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessibility tools and rules, with considerations of diverse needs among marginalized communities, such as deaf people/persons with hearing impairments, persons with intellectual disabilities, and persons with psychosocial disabilities. \nInclusive Service Delivery: Among 85 million officially estimated persons with disabilities, 38 million (44.7%) hold a disability certificate as of 2021. The task for service provision is daunting given the huge and diverse demands, and China has reached impressive coverage of services, especially in social protection and rehabilitation. To better align with the CRPD, the next step is to shift the focus from welfare provision to social inclusion, from special needs to inclusive services. This would require better rights awareness, accessibility, and reasonable accommodations in mainstream services, such as health, education, and employment; stronger support for caregiving instead of demanding family responsibilities; and more equitable allocation of resources for marginalized communities, such as persons with disabilities in rural areas, persons with severe or multiple disabilities, women with disabilities, and persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: According to the Ministry of Finance, in 2021, the national public budget expenditure on disability affairs was CNY 70.6 billion, roughly 0.287% of the total national general public budget expenditure. Majority of the disability budget (43.3%) was spent on living and care subsidies. Inclusive services such as inclusive education and employment, as championed by the CRPD, need stronger financial support. \nAccountability and governance: The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recommends an independent mechanism appointed to monitor the implementation of the CRPD. The CDPF regularly collects data from disability certificate holders and publishes annual updates in its key mandates, yet the data is not specifically aligned with the definition of disability or priority areas of the CRPD or SDGs. Data disaggregated by disability in mainstream statistical efforts need enhancement.",
            "Rehabilitation \nRehabilitation services are stipulated by the Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities (2017). Rehabilitation services are mainly delivered through the health system, DPF system, and the civil affairs system. Children aged 0-6 are prioritized, and offered full coverage of rehabilitation services. 78 As of 2017, 65.6% of persons with disabilities had access to rehabilitation services. 79 In 2021, 47.8% of those receiving rehabilitation services are persons with physical disabilities, and another 18.5% are people with psychiatric disabilities. 80 In recent years, progress has been made to expand rehabilitation from centralized medical rehabilitation to community-based rehabilitation by OPDs and self-help groups. 81 OPDs consulted call for more rehabilitation services aimed at community inclusion such as in educational or vocational settings. \nAssistive Technologies \nPublic provision of assistive devices are delivered through CDPF ’s rehabilitation departments and the civil affairs system. In 2017, 2.4 million persons with disabilities received assistive devices, 82 including white canes, vision-assistive devices, wheelchairs, prosthetic limbs, hearing aids, and cochlear implants. Consultations show that gaps exist in obtaining affordable, accessible, usable, and customized assistive devices for persons with disabilities. Currently, most assistive devices are still delivered through the government ’s centralized planning, which resulted in the lack of customization, preference for products with lower bidding price over quality, and rigid restrictions for eligibility. 83 In recent years, cash subsidies for assistive technologies of the users ’ own choice are being piloted in places like Beijing, Liaoning, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. 84 Many user-friendly assistive technologies provided by private sector remain unaffordable for most persons with disabilities without subsides from the government. \nCare Services \nOfficially, care services for persons with disabilities include home-based care, day care, and residential care services, targeting people with intellectual, psychosocial disabilities, and people with severe physical disabilities. 85 National standards were set in 2019. 86 Some care facilities offer “ assistive employment ” programs for both rehabilitation and employment purposes through low skill labor such as handicraft making. As of 2021, 608988 disability certificate holders are residing in 11,278 institutionalized care services nationwide, including boarding institutions, day care, and more comprehensive facilities. 87 Consultation shows that the care responsibility mostly falls on family members, especially women, with little alternative options, but some policies continue to encourage a family-centered care approach. \nFor mental health care, data on the proportion of government budget spent on institutionalized care versus community-based support are not available. 88 Although specific plan and timeline to transition to community-based support (as per the CRPD) is unknown, China is promoting community-based rehabilitation for persons with psychosocial disabilities, setting the goal to cover at least 80% of counties across the country by 2025. 89",
            "Article 28 Employment of disabled persons shall follow the principle of combining collective arrangement with individual arrangement. Preferential policies and measures of support and protection shall be adopted with a view to gradually popularizing, stabilizing and rationalizing employment of disabled persons through multiple channels, at various levels and in a variety of forms.\nArticle 29 The State and society shall set up welfare enterprises for disabled persons, workers sanatoria, massage therapy centres and other enterprises and institutions of welfare nature as a way of providing concentrated employment for disabled persons.\nArticle 30 The State shall promote the employment of disabled persons by various units. People's governments at all levels and departments concerned shall organize and provide guidance in this regard. State organs, public organizations, enterprises, institutions and urban and rural collective economic organizations shall employ a certain proportion of disabled persons in appropriate types of jobs and posts. The specific ratio may be determined by the people's governments of provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government in line with their actual conditions.\nArticle 31 Governmental departments concerned shall encourage and assist disabled persons to find employment through voluntary organization or to open individual business.\nArticle 32 Local people's governments at various levels and rural grassroots organizations shall organize and support disabled persons in rural areas to engage in crop planting, animal breeding, handicraft industry and other forms of production.\nArticle 33 The State shall implement the policy of tax reduction or exemption in relation to welfare enterprises and institutions for disabled persons and self-employed disabled workers in urban and rural areas, and provide assistance in production, management, technology, funds, materials supply, working sites and other fields.\nLocal people's governments and departments concerned shall determine the types of products suitable for production by disabled persons, give priority to the production of such products by welfare enterprises for disabled persons and gradually determine which products are to be produced exclusively by such enterprises.\nGovernmental departments concerned shall, in determining the quota for employing and engaging workers and staff members, allot a certain proportion of the quota to disabled persons.\nDepartments concerned shall, in verifying and issuing business licenses, give priority to disabled persons who apply for licenses as self-employed workers or businessmen and give them preferential treatment in allotting work sites and loans and in other ways.\nDepartments concerned shall provide assistance to disabled persons engaged in various kinds of labour in rural areas by way of production services, technical guidance, supply of materials for agricultural use, collection and purchase of farm and sideline products and loans.\nArticle 34 The State shall protect the property ownership and the managerial decision-making power of welfare enterprises and institutions for disabled persons, whose lawful rights and interests shall not be violated.\nNo discrimination shall be practised against disabled persons in employment, engagement, status regularization, promotion, determining technical or professional titles, payment for labour, welfare, labour insurance or in other aspects.\nNo enterprises or institutions shall deny disabled graduates assigned by the State from institutions of higher learning, polytechnic schools or technical schools solely on the ground of their disabilities; in case of such denial, the disabled graduates may appeal to departments concerned for disposition and the relevant departments shall instruct the enterprises or institutions concerned to accept the said graduate students.\nEnterprises and institutions where disabled persons work shall provide the disabled workers with appropriate working conditions and labour protection.\nArticle 35 Enterprises and institutions where disabled persons work shall provide in-service technical training to disabled employees with a view to upgrading their skills and techniques.\nChapter V Cultural Life\nArticle 36 The State and society shall encourage and assist disabled persons to participate in various cultural, sports and recreative activities and strive to meet the needs of the spiritual and cultural life of disabled persons.\nArticle 37 Cultural, sports and recreative activities for disabled persons should be directed at grassroots levels, integrated in public cultural life and geared to the different characteristics and needs of different categories of disabled persons with a view to bringing about extensive participation.",

            "Cross-cutting issues: The CDPF and its networks, ministries, OPDs, parent groups, CSOs, development partners, academia, and private sector form a vibrant sector working on the issue of disability in China. The challenge is to strengthen meaningful coordination within the government, and between OPDs and different stakeholders, especially when the social model of disability is not yet the consensus, resulting in scattered resources devoted to divergent, sometimes opposing, directions. Women with disabilities account for 49.33% of the total population with disabilities. Women face continued barriers in equal opportunities to education and employment, sexual and reproductive health, and marriage and social life. Further, voices of persons with disabilities and their representative groups, remain marginalized in the decision making, policy making, and humanitarian and development programming about disability. Among them, persons with disabilities in rural areas, persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities, and women with disabilities, are most disadvantaged. \nThis Situational Analysis reaffirms the importance of close partnerships between stakeholders, and the leadership of OPDs in making decisions about disability towards inclusion. Key recommendations of the report include: building meaningful mechanisms to enhance OPD participation that combines OPDs ’ expertise and other stakeholders ’ access to policy making; strengthening partnerships with specific government departments beyond its disabled persons ’ federations (DPFs) 1 , especially at local levels; and leveraging ongoing policy windows in accessibility, employment, and health.",
            "Approach \nGuiding principles \nTaking a rights-based approach rooted in the CRPD, this report follows the UNPRPD ’s framework of five preconditions for disability inclusion, namely, equality and non-discrimination, inclusive service delivery, accessibility, CRPD compliant budgeting, and accountability and governance; and three cross-cutting issues including participation, inequalities, and gender. \nThe research team follows the principle “ nothing about us without us ” in the design, implementation, and consultations of the situational analysis, ensuring the direct involvement of national and local organizations of persons with disabilities (OPDs), unofficial self-help groups of persons with disabilities, as well as individuals with disabilities. The core research team consists of members of a national OPD and an individual consultant in close coordination with the UNPRPD Taskforce in China, comprised of UNESCO, ILO, UNFPA, UN Women, and WHO. \nDespite time constraints, the research team strived to leverage the analysis as an opportunity to enhance relationships with and among stakeholders, bringing together government stakeholders, UNCT, and OPD leaders since the work plan design phase. Drafts of the report were sent to the UNCT, key government stakeholders, and OPDs for review, to ensure they are informed and involved in the analysis process. \nMethodology \nThis report followed the research questions listed in the “ UN PRPD guidance for conducting a situational country analysis of the rights of persons with disabilities. ” The analysis took place from March 2023 to June 2023. Due to the condensed timeframe of the analysis and the richness of existing literature, the analysis is primarily based on desk review of secondary literature and data, supplemented with key informant interviews, focus group discussions, an OPD preparatory workshop, and a multi-stakeholder consultation. \nFor desk research, the analysis draws comprehensively from existing literature on the preconditions of inclusion in China, ranging from the CRPD reviews, issue-based UN publications, government documents, official database and publications of the CDPF, articles published by OPDs, media reports, as well as Chinese and English language academic research. \nConsultations for the analysis focused on questions under-addressed by existing literature. Depending on stakeholders ’ accessibility preferences and availability, a mixture of consultation methods were adopted. The research team consulted in total 70 informants through in-person/online interviews, email questionnaires, focus group discussions, meetings, and soliciting written feedback and evidence. Email questionnaires and interviews were conducted with 33 OPDs, among which 42% of are unregistered grassroots groups, located in 18 different cities, working on promoting the rights of persons with physical, visual, intellectual, psychosocial, hearing, or multiple impairments, people with rare diseases, gender, and cross-disability issues. The team also interviewed and/or organized focus group discussions with 4 civil society organizations, and 5 government institutions, including the Education and Employment Department, Rights Protection Department, and Organizational and Liaison Department of the China Disabled Persons ’ Federation. Further, the research team reached out to 22 experts with domain-specific questions through written or online interviews, including scholars, lawyers, and UN agencies, among whom 6 are persons with disabilities. The draft report went through comprehensive reviews by 3 external experts, representing the perspectives of OPDs, policy makers, and development partners, with specializations in law, education, and OPD development. List of consulted stakeholders is not provided for protection of anonymity.",
            "Scope and limitations \nThe Situational Analysis is a combination of consolidating existing data and consulting diverse opinions. It is therefore not an original research based on primary sources or raw data collection. The Situational Analysis is designed to inform future program design on disability inclusion under the framework of UNPRPD, not an expert opinion by the United Nations. \nThe analysis has revealed significant gaps in data availability, which means the data currently available is insufficient to answer the full range of analytical questions and topics covered in the UNPRPD framework. Some questions are insufficiently addressed due to the complexity and scale of the issue, unavailability of reliable data, or potential risks for stakeholders. A few questions are listed as suggestions for more comprehensive research in the future. \nAmong existing data, consistency in the definition of disability is not guaranteed. Government data tend to focus on registered organizations, and disability certificate holders which follows an impairment-based, biomedical definition of disability. Other studies may use informal channels to reach persons with disabilities and unregistered groups. \nIn light of the limited scope of the report, the analysis does not include all the information available for each focus area. It prioritizes addressing the questions listed in the UNPRPD Situational Analysis Guideline and identifying gaps and opportunities for future collaboration among multiple stakeholders. Conducted between March and June 2023, the analysis may not reflect the latest developments of this fast-changing field. \nThe majority of OPDs consulted for the report are urban, registered organizations, representing the interests of people with physical or visual impairments, cross disabilities, or parent groups of people with intellectual disabilities, including organizations led by women with disabilities; but less so for deaf organizations, self-advocates with intellectual disabilities or psychosocial disabilities.

            "Approach \nGuiding principles \nTaking a rights-based approach rooted in the CRPD, this report follows the UNPRPD ’s framework of five preconditions for disability inclusion, namely, equality and non-discrimination, inclusive service delivery, accessibility, CRPD compliant budgeting, and accountability and governance; and three cross-cutting issues including participation, inequalities, and gender. \nThe research team follows the principle “ nothing about us without us ” in the design, implementation, and consultations of the situational analysis, ensuring the direct involvement of national and local organizations of persons with disabilities (OPDs), unofficial self-help groups of persons with disabilities, as well as individuals with disabilities. The core research team consists of members of a national OPD and an individual consultant in close coordination with the UNPRPD Taskforce in China, comprised of UNESCO, ILO, UNFPA, UN Women, and WHO. \nDespite time constraints, the research team strived to leverage the analysis as an opportunity to enhance relationships with and among stakeholders, bringing together government stakeholders, UNCT, and OPD leaders since the work plan design phase. Drafts of the report were sent to the UNCT, key government stakeholders, and OPDs for review, to ensure they are informed and involved in the analysis process. \nMethodology \nThis report followed the research questions listed in the “ UN PRPD guidance for conducting a situational country analysis of the rights of persons with disabilities. ” The analysis took place from March 2023 to June 2023. Due to the condensed timeframe of the analysis and the richness of existing literature, the analysis is primarily based on desk review of secondary literature and data, supplemented with key informant interviews, focus group discussions, an OPD preparatory workshop, and a multi-stakeholder consultation. \nFor desk research, the analysis draws comprehensively from existing literature on the preconditions of inclusion in China, ranging from the CRPD reviews, issue-based UN publications, government documents, official database and publications of the CDPF, articles published by OPDs, media reports, as well as Chinese and English language academic research. \nConsultations for the analysis focused on questions under-addressed by existing literature. Depending on stakeholders ’ accessibility preferences and availability, a mixture of consultation methods were adopted. The research team consulted in total 70 informants through in-person/online interviews, email questionnaires, focus group discussions, meetings, and soliciting written feedback and evidence. Email questionnaires and interviews were conducted with 33 OPDs, among which 42% of are unregistered grassroots groups, located in 18 different cities, working on promoting the rights of persons with physical, visual, intellectual, psychosocial, hearing, or multiple impairments, people with rare diseases, gender, and cross-disability issues. The team also interviewed and/or organized focus group discussions with 4 civil society organizations, and 5 government institutions, including the Education and Employment Department, Rights Protection Department, and Organizational and Liaison Department of the China Disabled Persons ’ Federation. Further, the research team reached out to 22 experts with domain-specific questions through written or online interviews, including scholars, lawyers, and UN agencies, among whom 6 are persons with disabilities. The draft report went through comprehensive reviews by 3 external experts, representing the perspectives of OPDs, policy makers, and development partners, with specializations in law, education, and OPD development. List of consulted stakeholders is not provided for protection of anonymity.",
            "Scope and limitations \nThe Situational Analysis is a combination of consolidating existing data and consulting diverse opinions. It is therefore not an original research based on primary sources or raw data collection. The Situational Analysis is designed to inform future program design on disability inclusion under the framework of UNPRPD, not an expert opinion by the United Nations. \nThe analysis has revealed significant gaps in data availability, which means the data currently available is insufficient to answer the full range of analytical questions and topics covered in the UNPRPD framework. Some questions are insufficiently addressed due to the complexity and scale of the issue, unavailability of reliable data, or potential risks for stakeholders. A few questions are listed as suggestions for more comprehensive research in the future. \nAmong existing data, consistency in the definition of disability is not guaranteed. Government data tend to focus on registered organizations, and disability certificate holders which follows an impairment-based, biomedical definition of disability. Other studies may use informal channels to reach persons with disabilities and unregistered groups. \nIn light of the limited scope of the report, the analysis does not include all the information available for each focus area. It prioritizes addressing the questions listed in the UNPRPD Situational Analysis Guideline and identifying gaps and opportunities for future collaboration among multiple stakeholders. Conducted between March and June 2023, the analysis may not reflect the latest developments of this fast-changing field. \nThe majority of OPDs consulted for the report are urban, registered organizations, representing the interests of people with physical or visual impairments, cross disabilities, or parent groups of people with intellectual disabilities, including organizations led by women with disabilities; but less so for deaf organizations, self-advocates with intellectual disabilities or psychosocial disabilities. Further, voices of more marginalized persons with disabilities, such as those living in rural areas, or with multiple/severe disabilities, are largely reflected through secondary literature and data. Like other studies, those who were able to respond to our consultation are tip of the iceberg that are already active and expressive, but the vast majority of the most marginalized communities remain difficult to reach and their voices remain unheard.",

            "2023 marks the 15 th year since China has ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2008. The landscape of disability inclusion in China has been undergoing deep transformation. This Situational Analysis provides an overview of the five preconditions for disability inclusion, as defined by the United Nations Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNPRPD) — equality and non-discrimination, inclusive service delivery, accessibility, CRPD compliant budgeting, and accountability and governance; and three cross-cutting issues including participation, inequalities, and gender. For each area of inquiry, the analysis follows the research questions provided by the UNPRPD, in identifying the gaps and opportunities to inform future development programs. The analysis is primarily based on secondary literature review, supplemented with consultations, carried out between March 2023 and June 2023. \nEquality and Non-Discrimination: China has more than 80 laws and 50 administrative regulations directly related to the interests of persons with disabilities, and regularly updated its national strategy for disability since 1991. Translating these commitments into better inclusion requires efforts to better align disabilityrelated policies and laws with the social model of disability, meaningfully engage OPDs independent from the state in decision making, and fully implement accessibility, reasonable accommodations, and antidiscrimination provisions. Culturally, the charity or medical model of disability remains dominant in public attitudes. \nAccessibility: China has issued more than 450 regulations, rules and normative documents on accessibility implementation and management. In recent years, campaigns are carried out to improve access to information. A further welcoming development is the new Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, passed on June 28, 2023. The effects of these policies depend on strong enforcement, sufficient remedies, and the meaningful engagement of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessibility tools and rules, with considerations of diverse needs among marginalized communities, such as deaf people/persons with hearing impairments, persons with intellectual disabilities, and persons with psychosocial disabilities. \nInclusive Service Delivery: Among 85 million officially estimated persons with disabilities, 38 million (44.7%) hold a disability certificate as of 2021. The task for service provision is daunting given the huge and diverse demands, and China has reached impressive coverage of services, especially in social protection and rehabilitation. To better align with the CRPD, the next step is to shift the focus from welfare provision to social inclusion, from special needs to inclusive services. This would require better rights awareness, accessibility, and reasonable accommodations in mainstream services, such as health, education, and employment; stronger support for caregiving instead of demanding family responsibilities; and more equitable allocation of resources for marginalized communities, such as persons with disabilities in rural areas, persons with severe or multiple disabilities, women with disabilities, and persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: According to the Ministry of Finance, in 2021, the national public budget expenditure on disability affairs was CNY 70.6 billion, roughly 0.287% of the total national general public budget expenditure. Majority of the disability budget (43.3%) was spent on living and care subsidies. Inclusive services such as inclusive education and employment, as championed by the CRPD, need stronger financial support. \nAccountability and governance: The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recommends an independent mechanism appointed to monitor the implementation of the CRPD. The CDPF regularly collects data from disability certificate holders and publishes annual updates in its key mandates, yet the data is not specifically aligned with the definition of disability or priority areas of the CRPD or SDGs. Data disaggregated by disability in mainstream statistical efforts need enhancement.",

            "The situation and rights of persons with disabilities is incorporated into the Common Country Analysis, UNSDCF and Joint Work Plans in full consultation with the UNTGD. As a result, the UNSDCF 2021-2025 has integrated disability inclusion by setting the commitment to “ leaving no one behind ” as one of its guiding principles and explicitly identifying persons with disabilities as one o f the groups more at risk of being left behind in China. Persons with disability are particularly referenced in parts related to rehabilitation services, full social inclusion, development, and legitimate rights and interests. Besides, UNSDCF also specifically stipulates that the participation of CDPF in the review and implementation of the UNSDCF will be made at the level of the Results Groups. \nSpecifically, under the UNSDCF Strategic Priority 1 “ People and Prosperity: Achieving innovation-driven, coordinated and shared development ”, Outcome 2 reads, “ People ’s lives in China are improved further as headways is made in ensuring access to childcare, education, healthcare services, elderly care, housing, and social assistance, and more people in China, including left-behind groups, benefit from equitable and high quality public services and social protection systems as well as accelerated efforts to reduced gender inequality and other forms of social inequality throughout the life-course. ” \nThe UN makes an effort to engage persons with disabilities and their representative organizations closely across ongoing programs at country level. One attempt was to make the UN premises more accessible. An assessment on the accessibility of the physical environment and services of all UN premises in China has been completed with support of the Accessibility Development Institute of Tsinghua University in 2021, with detailed recommendations provided for improvement. \nUNTGD provides a platform for international development partners to engage with OPDs. Currently, a few bilateral and multilateral donors such as the European Commission and British Council still have programs on disability. However, consultations show that international cooperation is increasingly scrutinized by authorities, and OPDs and local stakeholders are cautious about such engagement. \n1.6 Other Key Stakeholders (Academic, Private sector): Academic institutions or think tanks play an important role in the sector, due to their access to policy making channels. However, not all academics are aligned with the CRPD. OPDs are concerned that some academic institutions regard disability as an object of research but do not meaningfully engage OPDs, displacing rather than amplifying the voices of persons with disabilities. \nPrivate sector is increasingly active in disability inclusion, due to shifting funding structure for OPDs/CSOs, domestic policy incentives for disability-inclusive employment and services, and global corporate cultural change towards Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), and corporate social responsibility (CSR). A few social enterprises have been active in engaging the private sector. However, balancing the interests of business clients and the disability community is a challenge, which needs to involve different stakeholders, including government, disability advocates, and businesses themselves. A missed opportunity identified by informants is the lack of engagement with OPDs, reinforcing the fragmentation of limited resources of the field. Further, most businesses still lack the awareness of the social model of disability, taking a charity-based or tokenistic approach.",
            "• SDG 8.10: Implement the Plan for Promoting the Development of Financial Inclusion(2016-2020) to establish, by 2020, an inclusive financial services and security system to increase the accessibility of timely, affordable, and convenient financial services for the general public, especially for small and micro enterprises, farmers, urban low-incomers, poor people, people with disabilities and the elderly. By 2020, establish a modern insurance industry that is comprehensive, stable, well-functioning and credible. \n• SDG 10.3: Establish a more equitable and sustainable social protection system that better protect rights and interests of vulnerable social groups such as women, minors, and people with disabilities. \nIn China ’s Progress Report on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2021), persons with disabilities were reported as beneficiaries of China ’s progress on SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG4 (quality education), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). 190 In China ’s 2021 Voluntary National Review, people with disabilities are mentioned as beneficiaries of China ’s efforts in SDG 1.5, the world ’s largest social security system, and COVID response. No specific evidence was provided regarding the implementation of the disability-related goals listed in China ’s Action Plan. 191 There is no reference to OPD participation or capacity development support of OPDs in the Action Plan, Progress Report, or Voluntary National Review. \nThe UNSDCF (2021-2025) with China included disability-related support in “ Outcome 2: People ’s lives in China are improved further as headway is made in ensuring access to childcare, education, healthcare services, elderly care, housing, and social assistance, and more people in China, including left-behind groups, benefit from equitable and high-quality public services and social protection systems as well as accelerated efforts to reduce gender inequality and other forms of social inequality throughout the lifecourse. ” 192 The UNTGD is fully consulted in the country plans and strategies, processes and reporting. Other bilateral agencies and donors promote and engage in disability rights through their participation in the UNTGD meetings and activities, but most from disability-specific rather than disability mainstreaming perspectives.",
            "China has regularly updated its national strategy for disability since 1991, in the form of five-year development plans. By far, the State Council has issued eight five-year development plans for persons with disabilities, incorporated into the overall five-year plans for national economic and social development. Government at local levels shall make corresponding implementation plans and incorporate the implementation into government work evaluation. Annual monitoring, mid-term evaluation, concluding evaluation, third-party evaluation, and social satisfaction rate survey of the implementation of the five-year plans, are also stipulated. 41 The latest plan, the 14 th Five-year Plan on the Protection and Development of Persons with Disabilities (2021-2025), focuses on livelihood and employment, social protection, and basic public services. It sets the framework and indicators for implementation, although it is not specifically aligned with the CRPD or SDG plans and programs. \nA key legal harmonization effort, according to UN ESCAP, is “ the revision by China in 2008 of its 1990 law on the protection of persons with disabilities in an effort to incorporate the concepts and principles of the Convention into the legislation. This included a prohibition of disability discrimination, although it did not include definitions of disability or reasonable accommodation championed by the CRPD and did not explicitly state that denial of reasonable accommodation is disability discrimination. Subsequent ongoing reform efforts in China have since led to revision of the laws and regulations relating to education, transport, accessibility to the built environment and the mental health law in an effort to align them with the Convention. ” 42",
            "OPDs consulted for the report identified the following key gaps in accessibility as the most urgent: low public awareness of accessibility, weak enforcement of laws and standards, and the lack of participation of persons with disabilities in designing, monitoring, and evaluating accessibility. Expert informants note that enforcement of accessibility policies requires strong inter-ministerial coordination, which DPFs lack sufficient authority for. Awareness of local government leadership and the support of more powerful ministries is crucial. OPDs are also calling for strengthening the digital literacy of persons with disabilities, which is positively correlated with income levels in China. 64 A CDPF joined study found that due to lack of internet access or devices, prohibition by parents, and insufficient skills to use accessibility features, the usage rate of internet among youth with disabilities (aged 10-18) is merely 68%, significantly lower than youth without disabilities (94.9%). 65 While digital tools are important means of production, there lacks systemic assessment of the digital literacy of persons with disabilities. \n4. Inclusive Service Delivery \n4.1 Disability assessment and referral systems \nChina ’s current disability determination system does not align with the CRPD ’s social model definition of disability, or the WHO classification system. The Classification and Grading Criteria for Disability (GB/T 26341-2010) provides national standards for six types of disability, namely visual impairment/blind, Hearing impairment/deaf, Physical disability, Speech disability, Intellectual disability, and Psychiatric disabilities, with four grades under each type. Legal determination of disability is conducted by designated medical institutions, and the recognition of disability comes in the form of a certificate issued by the CDPF, which is a prerequisite for applying for disability subsidies and functions as an identification to access a range of benefits and services. Early i dentification and intervention mechanisms for children aged 0-6 are promoted by the N ational Disability Prevention Action Plan (2021-2025) and the Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities (2017). In 2021, 278,695 children with disabilities received basic rehabilitation services nationwide. 66 Quality of the services, disaggregated by type of disability, location, and gender, needs further assessment. \nPredominantly based on biomedical criteria, the system does not account for the social and environmental factors that affect people ’s capacity to undertake activities of daily life and participation. The determination criteria also prioritize people who could not recover after receiving treatment for over a year, and does not account for temporary impairments. 67 \nThe DPFs regularly update and monitor data of certified persons with disabilities, as basis for service provision and policy making. Among 85 million officially estimated persons with disabilities, only 38 million (44.7%) hold a disability certificate as of 2021, and 57.8% of them are men. 68 The low rate of certificate holding is in part due to stigma, lack of information, inaccessibility of the determination system, and 68中国残疾人联合会. (2021). 3-2全国持证残疾人人口基础库主要数据. \nmismatch with the official criteria. 69 Persons with disabilities can make complaints through the government service hotlines or petitioning (xinfang) reception system/staff/office of local governments and DPFs.",
            "part in voting and elections, joining representative bodies such as all levels of NPC and CPPCC, or working for state organs. There is no specific quota for persons with disabilities in the People ’s Congresses or Political Consultation Parties. In 2020, DPFs assisted 735 policy recommendations by people ’s congress and political consultation party delegates, and handled 1109 cases of their recommendations. 144 In practice, the lack of reasonable accommodations in political processes, the restrictions posed by mandatory public servant medical examinations, the tokenization of government employment quota, the preference for people with less severe disabilities, discriminatory social attitudes, and inadequate access to equal education, all contribute to the low rate of political participation of persons with disabilities. 145 Among persons with disabilities working at state institutions, persons with physical disabilities, and those with less severe disabilities are preferred. As of 2018, among local DPFs, 69.3% of municipal-level DPFs and 49.8% of county-level DPFs had staff members with disabilities. 146 As a step forward, in 2021, CDPF and four other ministries and departments issued a policy guidance regarding employing persons with disabilities in state organs, public institutions, and state-owned enterprises, explicitly requiring public sector employers to reasonably define the physical exam requirements for candidates with disabilities, and must not judge the candidates ’ health on the basis of their disability. 147 \n5. CRPD-compliant budgeting and financial management \nThere are three main mechanisms for the Chinese government to fund disability-related programs: regular public budget, special subsidy, and disability employment security fund (DESF). 148 From 2013 to 2017, the fiscal allocations from all levels of the government for persons with disabilities added up to over CNY 180 billion. 149 In 2021, the national public budget expenditure on disability affairs was CNY 70.6 billion, taking up 0.287% of the total national general public budget expenditure (24567.3 billion). 150 Compared to the scale of Chinese government budget (50-70 billion CNY per year), budgets of ongoing national development and humanitarian programs funded by international development partners are negligible. \nThe expenditures on disability affairs in 2021 included 30.6 billion on living and care subsidies (43.3%), 7.2 billion on rehabilitation, 6.6 billion on employment and poverty reduction, 5.5 billion on administrative costs, and 18.8 billion categorized as other expenditures. 151 In addition, CNY 16.1 billion of national public budget was spent on special education, 0.43% of the total education expenditures (3746.9 billion). 152 Article 48 of the 2017 Regulations on the Education of Persons with Disabilities stipulates that “ the financial funds allocated for compulsory education by local people ’s governments at all levels, as well as extra charges for education collected by these governments, shall have a certain proportion set aside for compulsory education for children and adolescents with disabilities. ” 153 Yet the proportion is not specified. \n146于娣.(2020).中国特色残联组织功能研究(博士学位论文,武汉理工大学). \nMost funding allocated for educating persons with disabilities are spent on special schools, and inclusive education in regular schools lacks financial support. 154 In 2021, The Action Plan for Special Education Development (2021-2025), issued in 2022 by the MOE, intends to increase the average government expenditure on compulsory education for children with disabilities from 6,000 yuan per student now to 7,000 yuan by 2025. 155",

            "2023 marks the 15 th year since China has ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2008. The landscape of disability inclusion in China has been undergoing deep transformation. This Situational Analysis provides an overview of the five preconditions for disability inclusion, as defined by the United Nations Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNPRPD) — equality and non-discrimination, inclusive service delivery, accessibility, CRPD compliant budgeting, and accountability and governance; and three cross-cutting issues including participation, inequalities, and gender. For each area of inquiry, the analysis follows the research questions provided by the UNPRPD, in identifying the gaps and opportunities to inform future development programs. The analysis is primarily based on secondary literature review, supplemented with consultations, carried out between March 2023 and June 2023. \nEquality and Non-Discrimination: China has more than 80 laws and 50 administrative regulations directly related to the interests of persons with disabilities, and regularly updated its national strategy for disability since 1991. Translating these commitments into better inclusion requires efforts to better align disabilityrelated policies and laws with the social model of disability, meaningfully engage OPDs independent from the state in decision making, and fully implement accessibility, reasonable accommodations, and antidiscrimination provisions. Culturally, the charity or medical model of disability remains dominant in public attitudes. \nAccessibility: China has issued more than 450 regulations, rules and normative documents on accessibility implementation and management. In recent years, campaigns are carried out to improve access to information. A further welcoming development is the new Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, passed on June 28, 2023. The effects of these policies depend on strong enforcement, sufficient remedies, and the meaningful engagement of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessibility tools and rules, with considerations of diverse needs among marginalized communities, such as deaf people/persons with hearing impairments, persons with intellectual disabilities, and persons with psychosocial disabilities. \nInclusive Service Delivery: Among 85 million officially estimated persons with disabilities, 38 million (44.7%) hold a disability certificate as of 2021. The task for service provision is daunting given the huge and diverse demands, and China has reached impressive coverage of services, especially in social protection and rehabilitation. To better align with the CRPD, the next step is to shift the focus from welfare provision to social inclusion, from special needs to inclusive services. This would require better rights awareness, accessibility, and reasonable accommodations in mainstream services, such as health, education, and employment; stronger support for caregiving instead of demanding family responsibilities; and more equitable allocation of resources for marginalized communities, such as persons with disabilities in rural areas, persons with severe or multiple disabilities, women with disabilities, and persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: According to the Ministry of Finance, in 2021, the national public budget expenditure on disability affairs was CNY 70.6 billion, roughly 0.287% of the total national general public budget expenditure. Majority of the disability budget (43.3%) was spent on living and care subsidies. Inclusive services such as inclusive education and employment, as championed by the CRPD, need stronger financial support. \nAccountability and governance: The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recommends an independent mechanism appointed to monitor the implementation of the CRPD. The CDPF regularly collects data from disability certificate holders and publishes annual updates in its key mandates, yet the data is not specifically aligned with the definition of disability or priority areas of the CRPD or SDGs. Data disaggregated by disability in mainstream statistical efforts need enhancement.",
            "Health \nGeneral healthcare \nChina ’s mainstream health policies and strategies predominantly regards disability as a target for prevention and clinical rehabilitation. The Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities (2017), the 14 th Five-year Plan on disability, 97 and the National Disability Prevention Action Plan (2021-2025), 98 all define preventing disability as specific health targets. The Healthy China 2030 Plan re-emphasizes the rehabilitation and prevention of disabilities, with a provision on “ enhancing the accessibility of medical institutions, and improving medical services for people with disabilities. ” 99 Some hospitals do provide accessible volunteer services, especially for persons with hearing or visual impairments. Consultations for this report reveal that mainstream medical system remain largely inaccessible, or unaffordable for certain communities of persons with rare diseases, and adopts a strong medical model of disability that fails to connect the patients ’ medical needs with social services. \nAccess to general healthcare is uneven. A recent analysis based on data from the National Survey on Basic Public Service Delivery of Persons with Disabilities revealed high rate of unmet healthcare needs. 15.4% of persons with disabilities lacked regular medical care when ill, and 45.6% reported needing more targeted rehabilitation services than they had. Rural residents were 13-40% more likely to lack healthcare, which was in part the result of the unequal access to health facilities, social participation, and health professionals at the community level. Among the respondents, persons with multiple disabilities experienced the highest levels of overall unmet healthcare needs, and people with physical disabilities had more unmet needs in rehabilitation. 100 Further, among China ’s over five million children with disabilities, 63% did not receive adequate healthcare, due to poor information, shortage of services, and affordability. 101 General health data disaggregated by disability, such as evidence of inequalities in health faced by persons with disabilities (corresponds to the OHCHR CRPD-SDG indicators) are not available. \nSexual and Reproductive Health and Rights Women with disabilities face additional barriers in accessing healthcare, especially sexual and reproductive health (SRH). 102 Women and youth with disabilities face higher risks of sexual violence, forced abortion, contraception and sterilization, financial and other forms of control, 103 yet they have limited access to SRH information and services. 104 In a UNESCO China and Humanity & Inclusion study, less than 20% young persons with disabilities in both urban and rural areas reported having counselling, referral services, or free contraceptives in their schools or communities. 105 A study co-funded by the CDPF \n105 Ibid. \nand State Council Committee on Women and Children ’s Work revealed large gaps in disabled women ’s access to healthcare and rehabilitation services. For instance, in Heilongjiang province, merely 50.2% women with disabilities received prenatal check during their last childbirth, 20.4 percentage points lower than women in general. Women with disabilities in rural areas had an even lower prenatal checking rate of 36.2%, and were significantly less likely (46.7 percentage points less) than urban women with disabilities to receive in-hospital child delivery care, indicating sharp disparity between urban and rural service provision. 106 Women with disabilities in poor households also experience higher prevalence of SRH related diseases. 107 An 2015 study tested the SRH knowledge of 248 women with disabilities, and the correction rate was 45.14%. 108 In response, UNESCO, UNFPA, Marie Stopes International, and Youren Foundation have conducted comprehensive sexuality education for persons with disabilities.",
            "Higher education \nHigher education remains largely inaccessible to persons with disabilities. As of 2019, a total of 43,900 persons with disabilities were enrolled in regular college in the entire country, 123 which means roughly 10,000 persons with disabilities graduate from college every year. By contrast, the number of college graduates without disabilities in 2020 was 8.74 million, 124 over 800 times more than persons with disabilities. Barriers faced by persons with disabilities prior to higher education include low primary school enrolment rate among persons with disabilities in rural areas, high dropout rate among children with disabilities, low educational expectation for persons with disabilities due to deeply entrenched stigma, inadequate support in school including reasonable accommodations, and limited options in colleges and majors open to persons with disabilities. 125 Due to continued advocacy, in 2014, a national policy began to allow the application for reasonable accommodations in the national college entrance exam (gaokao), and in 2017, rules on supporting students with disabilities taking regular gaokao were issued. 126 As a result, more students with disabilities were able to attend the exam, but the acceptance rate remains disproportionately low. \nEmployment and livelihood \nThe right to equal employment opportunities is stipulated in China ’s Constitution, the Labor Law, the LPPD, and Regulations on the Employment of Disabled Persons (2007). The Employment Promotion Law (2007) also contains an anti-discrimination provision regarding people with disabilities. 127 As a priority area of China ’s state disability programs, employment is typically included in the national five-year plans for disability. The latest 14 th Five-Year Plan sets goals for diversifying the types and improving the quality of employment of persons with disabilities. In 2022, the State Council adopted the Three-Year Action Plan on Promoting Disability Employment (2022-2024), setting the target of generating one million new jobs for persons with disabilities over three years, creating an important policy momentum. \nAs a form of affirmative action, China has adopted an employment quota scheme, one of the most important policy devices for promoting employment of persons with disabilities. Implemented in the late 1980s, this nationwide, legally binding scheme applies to all public and private sector organizations with a workforce exceeding 30 employees and operating for more than 3 years. It stipulates that at least 1.5% of all public or private entities ’ workforce must be persons with a disability, and non-compliance shall result in financial penalty paid to the Disabled Employment Security Fund (DESF), managed by the CDPF. 128 In practice, the quota policy has been poorly enforced, and even created perverse incentives such as “ fake employment ” practices that rent a disabled person ’s certificate as a token of compliance without real work opportunity. 129 Some OPDs point out that the policy may have caused more disability-based discrimination. 130 Consultations further show the complexity of the issue. Many persons with disabilities, due to systemic education and employment exclusion, end up depending on the income from renting their certificates to private companies. The funding scheme also contains a conflict of interest, as some local governments rely on DESF as a source of revenue, incentivizing officials to collect more fines than promoting real employment. 131",

            "3.2 Key Gaps in Accessibility \nBuilt Environment \nDespite increased policy commitment and investment, barriers in built environment remain. Data on the budgeting and monitoring of accessibility are not consistently available. According to a 2017 national survey conducted by China Consumer Society and CDPF, the overall coverage of barrier-free facilities (including accessible exits and entrances, elevators, wheelchair accessible bathrooms, and sign language proficiency among staff) in Chinese cities was 40.6%, among which hospitals had the highest coverage (67.4%) and commercial areas were the lowest (31.2%). Among existing barrier-free facilities, many were unavailable, occupied, under-maintained, and poorly designed. Public satisfaction rate for accessibility was also low. The survey shows barriers including technical challenges in architectural modification, lack of government coordination, lack of business incentives, and discriminatory attitudes towards consumers with disabilities. 55 \nInformal monitoring by OPDs also exist. For instance, a survey of over 600 travelers with disabilities shows that the top five barriers that persons with disabilities face when traveling are lack of accessible facilities (61.7%), unavailability of information about accessibility (46.4%), inaccessible hotels and transportation (41.9%), lack of accessible services (27.2%), and negative attitudes by service providers (18.8%). 56 The lack of barrier-free facilities not only impedes equal participation of persons with disabilities in society but also poses threats to the personal safety of persons with disabilities, as revealed by two incidents caused by poor accessibility leading to the deaths of two activists with disabilities. 57 58 The gaps further widen in rural areas. 59",
            "By 2017, China has issued 451 regulations, rules and normative documents on accessibility implementation and management. 44 The main regulation on accessibility is the Regulations on the Construction of Barrier-free Environments (2012), which stipulate that the construction and modification of roads, public buildings, public transport facilities, residential buildings and residential areas shall comply with the construction standards for barrier-free facilities. China also incorporated barrier-free construction into its national development plans, such as the Implementation Programme for Construction of Barrier-Free Environments during the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (2016 –2020), and the National Plan on New Urbanization (2014 –2020). National accessibility standards (GB 50763-2012) have also been adopted. Comprehensive data about the application of the technical standards are unavailable and should be addressed by future research. Accessibility is not yet mainstreamed into public procurement, according to government informants consulted. \nIn recent years, more attention has been paid to the accessibility of information and communications. In 2020, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and CDPF issued the Guiding Opinions on Promoting Information Accessibility, focusing on removing barriers of the affordability, devices, and services of information for persons with disabilities. 45 On 5 February 2022, China ratified the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled. In 2021, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology launched a whole year Action Plan to modify the accessibility of internet applications for elderly people and persons with disabilities, mitigating “ digital divides. ” 46 The Action Plan explicitly listed 158 websites and applications targeted for modification, ranging from those of governments, news outlets, airlines and railways, social media, and e-commerce, to search engines, banks, travel agencies, health services. By 2022, over 800 government entities modified their web accessibility, 320 websites passed an accessibility audit, and nearly 100 applications added accessibility features such as large fonts, high contrast, and easy to read pages. 47 The provision of accessible services such as sign language interpretation are mentioned in the Rule on the Construction of Accessible Environment, Guiding Opinions on Strengthening the Construction of Broadcasting and Television Public Service System, and National Basic Public Service Standards. China has also issued its Second National Sign Language and Braille Standardization Action Plan (2021-2025), and the Promotion Plan for National Universal Sign Language. \nIn 2022, the draft Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments solicited public opinions. The second draft was released for public comments in April 2023. The legislation is widely recognized as a catalytic opportunity for raising the awareness of accessibility, and specifying the implementation measures at the local level. Expert informants involved in the legislative process praised the draft law for emphasizing accessibility at the planning stage, and legally recognizing the universal benefits of accessibility. Controversies remain about how strict the enforcement will be. OPDs are concerned about the lack of clarity on accountability and remedies, 48 the insufficient attention to the needs of persons with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities, 49 and the significant room for discretion for duty-bearers to not comply with the law, 50 making it a symbolic law with “ no teeth. ”",
            "Rehabilitation \nRehabilitation services are stipulated by the Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities (2017). Rehabilitation services are mainly delivered through the health system, DPF system, and the civil affairs system. Children aged 0-6 are prioritized, and offered full coverage of rehabilitation services. 78 As of 2017, 65.6% of persons with disabilities had access to rehabilitation services. 79 In 2021, 47.8% of those receiving rehabilitation services are persons with physical disabilities, and another 18.5% are people with psychiatric disabilities. 80 In recent years, progress has been made to expand rehabilitation from centralized medical rehabilitation to community-based rehabilitation by OPDs and self-help groups. 81 OPDs consulted call for more rehabilitation services aimed at community inclusion such as in educational or vocational settings. \nAssistive Technologies \nPublic provision of assistive devices are delivered through CDPF ’s rehabilitation departments and the civil affairs system. In 2017, 2.4 million persons with disabilities received assistive devices, 82 including white canes, vision-assistive devices, wheelchairs, prosthetic limbs, hearing aids, and cochlear implants. Consultations show that gaps exist in obtaining affordable, accessible, usable, and customized assistive devices for persons with disabilities. Currently, most assistive devices are still delivered through the government ’s centralized planning, which resulted in the lack of customization, preference for products with lower bidding price over quality, and rigid restrictions for eligibility. 83 In recent years, cash subsidies for assistive technologies of the users ’ own choice are being piloted in places like Beijing, Liaoning, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. 84 Many user-friendly assistive technologies provided by private sector remain unaffordable for most persons with disabilities without subsides from the government. \nCare Services \nOfficially, care services for persons with disabilities include home-based care, day care, and residential care services, targeting people with intellectual, psychosocial disabilities, and people with severe physical disabilities. 85 National standards were set in 2019. 86 Some care facilities offer “ assistive employment ” programs for both rehabilitation and employment purposes through low skill labor such as handicraft making. As of 2021, 608988 disability certificate holders are residing in 11,278 institutionalized care services nationwide, including boarding institutions, day care, and more comprehensive facilities. 87 Consultation shows that the care responsibility mostly falls on family members, especially women, with little alternative options, but some policies continue to encourage a family-centered care approach. \nFor mental health care, data on the proportion of government budget spent on institutionalized care versus community-based support are not available. 88 Although specific plan and timeline to transition to community-based support (as per the CRPD) is unknown, China is promoting community-based rehabilitation for persons with psychosocial disabilities, setting the goal to cover at least 80% of counties across the country by 2025. 89",
            "1.2 Disability Movement (OPDs) \nBased on the UNPRPD guidance, this report defines organizations of persons with disabilities (OPDs) as follows: “ Organizations of persons with disabilities are led, directed and governed by persons with disabilities. A clear majority of their membership should be recruited among persons with disabilities themselves. ” 20 According to this definition, organizations “ that work on disability inclusion are considered organizations ‘ for ’ persons with disabilities ” and do not count as OPDs. \nThe actual number of OPDs in China is unavailable and should be addressed by future research. Current estimations range from roughly 150 OPDs across China, 21 to only a handful of OPDs with continuous programs and staff, according to OPD informants consulted. Representative OPDs include, but are not limited to: 22 \nCross-disability OPDs: Cross-disability OPDs are among the most active at the national level. They pursue a diverse range of advocacy and service goals, including independent living, awareness raising of the CRPD, diverse employment (e.g. One Plus One Disability Group); public education on disability and gender equality (e.g. Beijing Enable Sister Center); inclusive education, and accessibility (e.g. Minority Voices). \nImpairment-based OPDs: In addition to cross-disability OPDs, many organizations serving communities of people with specific kinds of impairments are also active. These include organizations by and for people with physical impairments (e.g. Beijing New Start Foundation), deaf and/or people with hearing impairments (e.g. ProSigner, Know Deaf), people with visual impairments (e.g. Golden Cane 23 ), people with rare diseases (e.g. Illness Challenge Foundation), people with cerebral palsy (e.g. Angel House), and people on the autism spectrum (e.g. Mutual Support for Asperger's). \nOPDs in China tend to concentrate in urban areas, leaving a significant gap in smaller cities and rural areas. Many OPDs take the form of unregistered, online virtual groups, or small self-help groups, and very few have more than five full-time staff. Among existing OPDs, persons with intellectual disabilities, people with psychosocial disabilities, elderly people with disabilities, persons with disabilities living in rural areas, people with multiple impairments, and LGBTI persons with disabilities are underrepresented. For persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities, self-advocacy groups are still rare. Most of their representative groups are led by parents.",

            "OPDs consulted for the report identified the following key gaps in accessibility as the most urgent: low public awareness of accessibility, weak enforcement of laws and standards, and the lack of participation of persons with disabilities in designing, monitoring, and evaluating accessibility. Expert informants note that enforcement of accessibility policies requires strong inter-ministerial coordination, which DPFs lack sufficient authority for. Awareness of local government leadership and the support of more powerful ministries is crucial. OPDs are also calling for strengthening the digital literacy of persons with disabilities, which is positively correlated with income levels in China. 64 A CDPF joined study found that due to lack of internet access or devices, prohibition by parents, and insufficient skills to use accessibility features, the usage rate of internet among youth with disabilities (aged 10-18) is merely 68%, significantly lower than youth without disabilities (94.9%). 65 While digital tools are important means of production, there lacks systemic assessment of the digital literacy of persons with disabilities. \n4. Inclusive Service Delivery \n4.1 Disability assessment and referral systems \nChina ’s current disability determination system does not align with the CRPD ’s social model definition of disability, or the WHO classification system. The Classification and Grading Criteria for Disability (GB/T 26341-2010) provides national standards for six types of disability, namely visual impairment/blind, Hearing impairment/deaf, Physical disability, Speech disability, Intellectual disability, and Psychiatric disabilities, with four grades under each type. Legal determination of disability is conducted by designated medical institutions, and the recognition of disability comes in the form of a certificate issued by the CDPF, which is a prerequisite for applying for disability subsidies and functions as an identification to access a range of benefits and services. Early i dentification and intervention mechanisms for children aged 0-6 are promoted by the N ational Disability Prevention Action Plan (2021-2025) and the Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities (2017). In 2021, 278,695 children with disabilities received basic rehabilitation services nationwide. 66 Quality of the services, disaggregated by type of disability, location, and gender, needs further assessment. \nPredominantly based on biomedical criteria, the system does not account for the social and environmental factors that affect people ’s capacity to undertake activities of daily life and participation. The determination criteria also prioritize people who could not recover after receiving treatment for over a year, and does not account for temporary impairments. 67 \nThe DPFs regularly update and monitor data of certified persons with disabilities, as basis for service provision and policy making. Among 85 million officially estimated persons with disabilities, only 38 million (44.7%) hold a disability certificate as of 2021, and 57.8% of them are men. 68 The low rate of certificate holding is in part due to stigma, lack of information, inaccessibility of the determination system, and 68中国残疾人联合会. (2021). 3-2全国持证残疾人人口基础库主要数据. \nmismatch with the official criteria. 69 Persons with disabilities can make complaints through the government service hotlines or petitioning (xinfang) reception system/staff/office of local governments and DPFs.",
            "Cross-cutting issues: The CDPF and its networks, ministries, OPDs, parent groups, CSOs, development partners, academia, and private sector form a vibrant sector working on the issue of disability in China. The challenge is to strengthen meaningful coordination within the government, and between OPDs and different stakeholders, especially when the social model of disability is not yet the consensus, resulting in scattered resources devoted to divergent, sometimes opposing, directions. Women with disabilities account for 49.33% of the total population with disabilities. Women face continued barriers in equal opportunities to education and employment, sexual and reproductive health, and marriage and social life. Further, voices of persons with disabilities and their representative groups, remain marginalized in the decision making, policy making, and humanitarian and development programming about disability. Among them, persons with disabilities in rural areas, persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities, and women with disabilities, are most disadvantaged. \nThis Situational Analysis reaffirms the importance of close partnerships between stakeholders, and the leadership of OPDs in making decisions about disability towards inclusion. Key recommendations of the report include: building meaningful mechanisms to enhance OPD participation that combines OPDs ’ expertise and other stakeholders ’ access to policy making; strengthening partnerships with specific government departments beyond its disabled persons ’ federations (DPFs) 1 , especially at local levels; and leveraging ongoing policy windows in accessibility, employment, and health.",
            "Information and communications \nGaps continue to exist between the high demand for accessible information and the poor supply. First, as consultations for this report reveal, the accessibility of websites and applications remain fragmented and uneven. Some software developed “ accessible versions ” as alternative services provided for users with disabilities, but these versions are often inferior to and less updated than mainstream versions. Some applications become even less accessible after modification, because of the lack of participation of users with disabilities. Lacking systemic planning and coordination, iteration of applications can overwrite previous accessibility features. \nThe legislative system of information accessibility is incomplete, according to the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT). 60 Current laws and regulations lack coherence, clarity of responsibilities, and the power to enforce. Existing standards for accessibility are “ encouraged ” rather than mandatory. They are impractical, poorly implemented, and outdated. In addition, CAICT points out that internet applications typically fail to consider the needs of persons with disabilities at the design phase, making it difficult for modifications later on. 61 \nAccessible services \nThe draft law on accessible environment included provisions on accessible services. Currently, basic social services in support of access to information, such as sign language interpretation, relay services, live captioning, alternative texts, audio description, and easy-to-read formats for public information, are still lacking. These problems were heightened during emergency communication during COVID-19. Deaf/hearing impaired informants note that most news reporting does not include captioning. Highquality sign language interpretation is rare. Advocates still cite an early survey published by CDPF in 1998, revealing that 78 –89% of deaf people understood less than 60% of the Chinese sign language signed on TV news channels. 62 According to the National Sign Language and Braille Research Center in 2014, only 63.1% of deaf students “ somewhat ” understood the sign language used by hearing teachers in deaf schools. 63 \nDeaf informants consulted highlight that the quantity and quality of sign language interpretation have significant gaps in China. They are concerned that, due to hearing-centric policies that prioritize speech therapy and hearing rehabilitation over sign language acquisition, children with hearing impairments experience various degrees of language deprivation, resulting in the systemic exclusions of deaf/hard of hearing people in education, work, and social life. Even in disability inclusion programs and events, deaf informants have experienced a lack of meaningful language accommodation and equal participation with hearing persons with disabilities. \n61 Ibid.",
            "3.2 Key Gaps in Accessibility \nBuilt Environment \nDespite increased policy commitment and investment, barriers in built environment remain. Data on the budgeting and monitoring of accessibility are not consistently available. According to a 2017 national survey conducted by China Consumer Society and CDPF, the overall coverage of barrier-free facilities (including accessible exits and entrances, elevators, wheelchair accessible bathrooms, and sign language proficiency among staff) in Chinese cities was 40.6%, among which hospitals had the highest coverage (67.4%) and commercial areas were the lowest (31.2%). Among existing barrier-free facilities, many were unavailable, occupied, under-maintained, and poorly designed. Public satisfaction rate for accessibility was also low. The survey shows barriers including technical challenges in architectural modification, lack of government coordination, lack of business incentives, and discriminatory attitudes towards consumers with disabilities. 55 \nInformal monitoring by OPDs also exist. For instance, a survey of over 600 travelers with disabilities shows that the top five barriers that persons with disabilities face when traveling are lack of accessible facilities (61.7%), unavailability of information about accessibility (46.4%), inaccessible hotels and transportation (41.9%), lack of accessible services (27.2%), and negative attitudes by service providers (18.8%). 56 The lack of barrier-free facilities not only impedes equal participation of persons with disabilities in society but also poses threats to the personal safety of persons with disabilities, as revealed by two incidents caused by poor accessibility leading to the deaths of two activists with disabilities. 57 58 The gaps further widen in rural areas. 59",
            "8.4 COVID-19 \nThe Law on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, which is the legal basis for China ’s COVID policies, is criticized for lacking a disability lens and overlooks the needs of persons with disabilities in terms of access to information, basic goods and services, medications and assistive devices, and care. 201 In 2020, the CDPF issued a Guideline on the Protection of Disabled Persons in Severe Infectious Disease Epidemics, which mainly provides generic guidance for self-protection. 202 \nIn 2021, Raoul Wallenberg Institute of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law conducted a participatory action research with the OPD Minority Voices, offering the first comprehensive study of COVID-19 experiences of persons with disabilities. According to the report, persons with disabilities have experienced disruptions of access to regular healthcare, community living, employment, and education during lockdowns. Top unmet needs include purchasing medical supplies, worsened mental health, paused access to delivery services, sense of isolation, lack of financial relief, loss of livelihood, lack of remote learning support, and inaccessibility of remote learning tools. 203 \nIn response, OPDs, volunteer groups, and individuals with disabilities have actively participated in community-level mutual assistance, and disability-inclusive advocacy. For instance, in early 2020, deaf persons ’ organization ProSigner, based in Wuhan, organized to support local deaf communities to access accurate public health information and distributing medical supplies such as masks, disinfectants, and gloves. 204 A network of volunteers from across the country organized to support people with disabilities in coordination with local CSOs, providing information, shopping, counselling, and resource referral services. Inclusion China launched a mutual assistance network among families of people with intellectual disabilities. Multiple OPDs/CSOs such as One Plus One, Able Development Institute, Voices of the Disabled, and the Disability COVID Support Volunteer Network, drafted specific handbooks and guidelines regarding the science of COVID, self-protection measures, response to domestic violence during quarantine, and accessible emergency response and service provision. Women ’s OPD BEST organized donations of sanitary care products for women with disabilities. 205 \nhttps://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/C_GmGMiqGQI3teh9QK_JtQ This section focuses on the overall key challenges in systems, structures, practices, and capacities and discusses the underlying causes. Specific gaps under each area of inquiry will not be repeated here.",
            "1.7 Key Stakeholder Coordination Mechanisms \nIn China, most OPDs are unregistered, virtual groups rather than registered organizations with a physical presence, reachable through informal networks of key individuals within disability community. Administratively, the threshold for registration as a social organization with the Ministry of Civil Affairs is high. According to a 2015 survey of 110 OPDs in China, only 58% of OPDs are legally registered with bureaus of civil affairs. 29 OPD informants point out that registered OPDs also face strict administrative requirements. Financially, many OPDs ’ funding sources were impacted by the Law on Administration of Activities of Overseas Nongovernmental Organisations, adopted in 2016, which significantly restricted domestic NGOs and individuals from obtaining funding from overseas NGOs. 30 Main funding sources available now are the government, the general public, and the private sector. These funders tend to prefer more traditional approaches to disability such as the charity or medical model, thus disadvantaging OPDs promoting the social model of disability. OPDs consulted for this report, mostly grassroots, lack experience working with INGOs, the UN, or academic partners. Key OPD informants observe that compared to other civil society groups, OPDs in China tend to rely on individual leaders and face more challenges in professional development, due to systemic exclusion of persons with disabilities in social participation, such as quality education. \nWithin China ’s national development frameworks and human rights monitoring and reporting, disability is represented as a special issue, rather than mainstreamed as a cross-cutting issue across sectors. China ’s national human rights monitoring and reporting such as human rights white papers refer to disability as one thematic issue among “ vulnerable groups ” such as women, children, ethnic minority, and elderly people. Consultation shows that the CDPF and its local networks dominate the current coordination mechanism to facilitate disability-related actions across different sectors and levels of the government. \n1.8 Stakeholder Capacity Gaps \nWithin the government, the current coordination mechanism guarantees financial and human resources on disability across different levels of the government through the CDPF networks. This bureaucratic division of labor, however, tend to pigeon-hole disability as CDPF ’s responsibility and lacks the support from mainstream ministries. Expert informants point out that as a “ semi-governmental, semi-civil ” organization, CDPF does not have the same administrative power as the ministries, making certain coordination with other ministries difficult. \nCoordination mechanisms between government and OPDs are inconsistent. Formal mechanisms for stateendorsed CSOs/OPDs to coordinate with the government do exist, such as the Disabled People ’s Representative Congress. For independent OPDs, however, coordination with the government is limited. OPDs that have successfully engaged the government tend to leverage informal channels such as joint programs with DPFs or the special associations, working with key individuals within the government, or submitting policy proposals through elected National People ’s Congress (NPC) and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) representatives. Nevertheless, most OPDs lack access to these mechanisms. In the limited scope of consultations for this report, informants note that formal mechanisms of OPDs participation tend to be symbolic, and the power imbalance makes meaningful dialogue difficult. Meanwhile, results of informal mechanisms are highly contingent. For more detail, see Section 7.1.",

            "4.3 Mainstream Services \nSocial protection \nChina ’s social protection system for persons with disabilities include three main mechanisms: 1) welfare subsidies (fuli butie), such as living subsidies for disabled persons in hardships, and care subsidies for persons with severe disabilities; 2) social insurance subsidies (shehui baoxian butie), such as pension and medical insurance subsidies; and 3) special assistance (zhuanxiang jiuzhu), such as minimum living standard guarantee (dibao), and assistance for disaster, healthcare, education, and housing. 90 \nChina has reached wide coverage of social protection for persons with disabilities. For example, living allowances for poor people with disabilities and nursing subsidies for severely disabled persons now cover more than 24 million people. 10.67 million people with disabilities are included in the system of subsistence allowances. All poor persons with disabilities are covered by basic medical insurance and serious illness insurance, according to an official white paper. 91 \nBy 2021, China has declared success in lifting more than 7 million persons with disabilities out of absolute poverty. 92 Yet persons with disabilities remain economically marginalized. Experts estimate that 36% to 44% of certified persons with disabilities in China can be considered under “ relative poverty. ” 93 In 2019, over 30% of total disability certificate holders received living subsidies for disabled persons in hardships, and care subsidies for persons with severe disabilities. 94 Social protection remains an important source of income for persons with disabilities, making up 13.2% of total disabled persons ’ household income on average. 95 Households with the lowest income are most dependent on social protection, but their average income from social protection was merely CNY 2,631.30 per year, as of 2019. 96",
            "6.2 National accountability mechanisms \nOfficially, the State Council Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work is responsible for promoting the implementation of the CRPD. Information on the effectiveness of the Committee in mainstreaming CRPD across all sectors and levels of government is lacking. 160 There is no independent mechanism appointed to monitor the implementation of the CRPD. 161 \nThe CDPF is the focal point overseeing the implementation of the CRPD, responsible for monitoring whether the creation and implementation of policies and plans relating to the rights of persons with disabilities are consistent with the CRPD principles. Some CSOs were invited to consultations for CRPD reporting but OPDs were underrepresented. 162 Most CSOs involved were specialized associations funded by the CDPF, or service provision organizations led by people without disabilities. In 2018, the State Council Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work published China ’s draft CRPD country report for public opinions, but the time window was fewer than 24 hours, making it impractical for meaningful comments to be incorporated. 163 A few OPDs have engaged in CRPD monitoring through shadow reporting, but most OPDs consulted have not engaged in CRPD monitoring mechanisms. \nChina has completed its combined second and third periodic reports. The review sessions concluded in September 2022. Major findings of the concluding observations suggest that China ’s disability-related policies and laws are not yet fully aligned with the social model of disability, OPDs independent from the state lack meaningful participation in policy-making, and China ’s legal system lacks anti-discrimination frameworks and effective provisions guaranteeing reasonable accommodations. 164 \nIn China ’s National Plan on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 165 disability was explicitly mentioned in China ’s action plan for goal 4 (quality education), 8 (decent work and economic growth), and 10 (reduced inequalities). In China ’s Progress Report on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2021), persons with disabilities were reported as beneficiaries of China ’s progress on SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG4 (quality education), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). 166 Concrete achievements include: \n• “ To ensure the right to education for people with disabilities, the second phase of the Special Educational Enhancement Program was fully completed from 2017 to 2020. By the end of 2020, the enrollment rate of children with disabilities in compulsory education exceeded 95%; a total of 880,800 special education students had been enrolled, 388,800 more than in 2016. ” \n• “ From 2016 to 2020, 1.81 million people with disabilities got employed in urban and rural areas. As of the end of 2020, 2.39 million people with disabilities obtained flexible employment (including community and home employment). ” 167 \nIn China ’s 2021 Voluntary National Review, people with disabilities are mentioned as beneficiaries of China ’s efforts in SDG 1.5, the world ’s largest social security system, and COVID response. No specific evidence was provided regarding the implementation of the disability-related goals listed in China ’s Action Plan. 168",

To better support countries, the PRPD believes it is necessary to understand what the main bottlenecks and priorities are in each country in relation to the fulfilment of the CRPD. This Situational Analysis was developed as a requirement of the inception phase of the fourth call for proposals of the UNPRPD Multi-Partner Trust Fund (UNPRPD MPTF). Key objectives of the 4 th call include advancing CRPD implementation at country level by focusing on the preconditions for disability inclusion across sectors, and improving the implementation of disability inclusive SDGs at the country level. The main goal of the situational analysis is to inform the design of future cross-sector PRPD programs in China, with the report serving as a baseline. The analysis also aims to build working relationships between UN entities, government, OPDs, other civil society organizations, private sector and academia, as a basis for future co-design of programs; to strengthen the capacity of above stakeholders to include and address the rights of persons with disabilities more effectively; and to inspire disability inclusion adjustments in ongoing UN programs and processes. \nIntroduction to disability in China \nOfficially, China is home to 85 million persons with disabilities, roughly 6% of the total population. The most recent national survey on disability (2006) found that 17.8% of households in China had family members with disabilities. 75.04% of persons with disabilities resided in rural areas, 53.24% were above 60 years old, and 51.55% were men. 2 China ’s Law on the Protection of Disabled Persons (LPPD) defines a person with disabilities as “ one who has abnormalities of loss of a certain organ or function, psychologically or physiologically, or in anatomical structure and has lost wholly or in part the ability to perform an activity in the way considered normal. ” Based on this definition, six categories of disability are certified, including visual disabilities, hearing disabilities, physical disabilities, speech disabilities, intellectual disabilities, and psychiatric disabilities, with four grades under each category. By 2021, 38 million persons with disabilities held a disability certificate, among whom 22 million were men, and 30.1 million were registered as rural residents. 3 Among the disability certificate holders, 18.7% were illiterate, 40.3% received primary education, and 30.3% went to middle school. 4 \nThe China Disabled Persons Federation (CDPF), a semi-governmental mass organization with vice-ministry level status, was founded in 1988, marking significant national commitment to disability issu"

            "Higher education \nHigher education remains largely inaccessible to persons with disabilities. As of 2019, a total of 43,900 persons with disabilities were enrolled in regular college in the entire country, 123 which means roughly 10,000 persons with disabilities graduate from college every year. By contrast, the number of college graduates without disabilities in 2020 was 8.74 million, 124 over 800 times more than persons with disabilities. Barriers faced by persons with disabilities prior to higher education include low primary school enrolment rate among persons with disabilities in rural areas, high dropout rate among children with disabilities, low educational expectation for persons with disabilities due to deeply entrenched stigma, inadequate support in school including reasonable accommodations, and limited options in colleges and majors open to persons with disabilities. 125 Due to continued advocacy, in 2014, a national policy began to allow the application for reasonable accommodations in the national college entrance exam (gaokao), and in 2017, rules on supporting students with disabilities taking regular gaokao were issued. 126 As a result, more students with disabilities were able to attend the exam, but the acceptance rate remains disproportionately low. \nEmployment and livelihood \nThe right to equal employment opportunities is stipulated in China ’s Constitution, the Labor Law, the LPPD, and Regulations on the Employment of Disabled Persons (2007). The Employment Promotion Law (2007) also contains an anti-discrimination provision regarding people with disabilities. 127 As a priority area of China ’s state disability programs, employment is typically included in the national five-year plans for disability. The latest 14 th Five-Year Plan sets goals for diversifying the types and improving the quality of employment of persons with disabilities. In 2022, the State Council adopted the Three-Year Action Plan on Promoting Disability Employment (2022-2024), setting the target of generating one million new jobs for persons with disabilities over three years, creating an important policy momentum. \nAs a form of affirmative action, China has adopted an employment quota scheme, one of the most important policy devices for promoting employment of persons with disabilities. Implemented in the late 1980s, this nationwide, legally binding scheme applies to all public and private sector organizations with a workforce exceeding 30 employees and operating for more than 3 years. It stipulates that at least 1.5% of all public or private entities ’ workforce must be persons with a disability, and non-compliance shall result in financial penalty paid to the Disabled Employment Security Fund (DESF), managed by the CDPF. 128 In practice, the quota policy has been poorly enforced, and even created perverse incentives such as “ fake employment ” practices that rent a disabled person ’s certificate as a token of compliance without real work opportunity. 129 Some OPDs point out that the policy may have caused more disability-based discrimination. 130 Consultations further show the complexity of the issue. Many persons with disabilities, due to systemic education and employment exclusion, end up depending on the income from renting their certificates to private companies. The funding scheme also contains a conflict of interest, as some local governments rely on DESF as a source of revenue, incentivizing officials to collect more fines than promoting real employment. 131",

            "The overall labor participation rate remains low for persons with disabilities. Although official data estimates over half of working-age people with disabilities are employed, 132 about three quarters of these jobs are categorized as either agriculture, cultivation, or “ flexible ” employment, 133 namely temporary or part-time jobs (see Figure 1). Persons with disabilities are significantly less likely to work in higher skilled white-collar occupations. 134 As key targets of poverty alleviation, as of 2018, households of persons with disabilities earned less than 60% of the national average and the gap continues to widen. 135 Among all, persons with intellectual disabilities were least accepted by employers. According to a report based on surveys of 203 families in Guangzhou, only 2% of persons with intellectual disabilities in Guangzhou had meaningful employment. 136 A recent survey of 328 companies shows that 70.4% persons with disabilities hired by these employers are people with physical impairments, and 59.8% are in supporting or administrative roles. 137 \n131 In consultation, informants have identified multiple systemic barriers to inclusive employment, including: \n• inadequate access to equal education opportunities, including the lack of high-quality basic education, as well as vocational training and skill development opportunities for persons with disabilities; \n• the lack of anti-discrimination and disability mainstreaming laws and policies; \n• lack of public sector role models for disability-inclusive employment; \n• lack of disability inclusion expertise among employment service providers; \n• discriminatory social attitudes towards persons with disabilities by families and friends, employers, co-workers, and even persons with disabilities themselves; \n• Lack of accessibility and reasonable accommodations to and at workplaces. \nILO ’s Global Business and Disability Network (GBDN) China Chapter has made progress in influencing the private sector to recruit and include persons with disabilities. While attracting local companies to join GBDN-China and promoting inclusive employment practices remains a challenge, GBDN-China presents an opportunity to generate good practices and share experiences with other companies in China.",
            "2.2 Barriers to Equity \nThe Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities observed systemic barriers to the inclusion of persons with disabilities in China, including that 43 : \n• disability-related policies and laws do not fully align with the social model of disability; \n• OPDs independent from the state are not meaningfully included in policy-making; \n• anti-discrimination and reasonable accommodations are not legally guaranteed or fully implemented; \n• there are limited mechanisms in preventing violence, trafficking, forced marriage, neglect, or abandonment of women and children with disabilities; \n• substitute decision-making regime persists to deny or restricts adults with disabilities in their legal capacity to act; \n• lack of procedural accommodation, accessible information, and inaccessible buildings impedes disabled persons ’ access to justice; \n• discriminatory provisions in the LPPD allow for coercive institutionalization and treatment of persons with psychosocial disabilities; \n• accessibility regulations and standards are insufficiently enforced; \n• the state pressures on and censors rights-based advocacy; \n• segregated special education remains the norm and mainstream schools lack support regarding inclusive education; \n• the right to freely choose occupations and access to just and favourable conditions of work is lacking; \n• and legal restrictions to disabled persons ’ political participation still persists. \nAmong these barriers, consultations for this report identified the social prejudice and discrimination against persons with disabilities as the most fundamental.

These include: \n• “ Limited legal knowledge. \n• Unaffordability of current legal services, and the general lack of knowledge about free legal aid services. \n• For persons with [psychosocial] and intellectual disabilities and others who are placed under adult guardianship, their legal capacity is restricted. \n• In the process of providing criminal legal aid for persons with visual, hearing, speech and mental impairments, there is a lack of effective and timely support in communication and information accessibility. \n• For persons with physical or visual impairments, if and when they face discrimination in the realms of transportation, education and employment, they cannot resort to the judicial system for equality. \n• Women with disabilities are more vulnerable to rights infringement and have less access to justice. \n• Continuous social discrimination and prejudice that all [persons with disabilities] face critically restricts their ability to navigate the judicial system effectively in order to realize their human rights and also undermines their confidence and adds to their already existing dismay. ” The report concludes that the key to improving equal access to justice is greater accessibility support and reasonable accommodations throughout the judicial process. \nParticipation in public and political life China is not short of policies and laws that protect the political participation right of persons with disabilities on paper. The 2008 LPPD stipulates that “ Persons with disabilities shall enjoy equal rights with other citizens in political, economic, cultural and social respects and in family life as well ” (Article 3) and that “ competent departments in charge of the organization of elections shall facilitate persons with disabilities to vote in elections.

            "OPDs consulted for the report identified the following key gaps in accessibility as the most urgent: low public awareness of accessibility, weak enforcement of laws and standards, and the lack of participation of persons with disabilities in designing, monitoring, and evaluating accessibility. Expert informants note that enforcement of accessibility policies requires strong inter-ministerial coordination, which DPFs lack sufficient authority for. Awareness of local government leadership and the support of more powerful ministries is crucial. OPDs are also calling for strengthening the digital literacy of persons with disabilities, which is positively correlated with income levels in China. 64 A CDPF joined study found that due to lack of internet access or devices, prohibition by parents, and insufficient skills to use accessibility features, the usage rate of internet among youth with disabilities (aged 10-18) is merely 68%, significantly lower than youth without disabilities (94.9%). 65 While digital tools are important means of production, there lacks systemic assessment of the digital literacy of persons with disabilities. \n4.

Legal determination of disability is conducted by designated medical institutions, and the recognition of disability comes in the form of a certificate issued by the CDPF, which is a prerequisite for applying for disability subsidies and functions as an identification to access a range of benefits and services. Early i dentification and intervention mechanisms for children aged 0-6 are promoted by the N ational Disability Prevention Action Plan (2021-2025) and the Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities (2017).

            "2023 marks the 15 th year since China has ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2008. The landscape of disability inclusion in China has been undergoing deep transformation. This Situational Analysis provides an overview of the five preconditions for disability inclusion, as defined by the United Nations Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNPRPD) — equality and non-discrimination, inclusive service delivery, accessibility, CRPD compliant budgeting, and accountability and governance; and three cross-cutting issues including participation, inequalities, and gender. For each area of inquiry, the analysis follows the research questions provided by the UNPRPD, in identifying the gaps and opportunities to inform future development programs. The analysis is primarily based on secondary literature review, supplemented with consultations, carried out between March 2023 and June 2023. \nEquality and Non-Discrimination: China has more than 80 laws and 50 administrative regulations directly related to the interests of persons with disabilities, and regularly updated its national strategy for disability since 1991. Translating these commitments into better inclusion requires efforts to better align disabilityrelated policies and laws with the social model of disability, meaningfully engage OPDs independent from the state in decision making, and fully implement accessibility, reasonable accommodations, and antidiscrimination provisions. Culturally, the charity or medical model of disability remains dominant in public attitudes. \nAccessibility: China has issued more than 450 regulations, rules and normative documents on accessibility implementation and management. In recent years, campaigns are carried out to improve access to information. A further welcoming development is the new Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, passed on June 28, 2023. The effects of these policies depend on strong enforcement, sufficient remedies, and the meaningful engagement of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessibility tools and rules, with considerations of diverse needs among marginalized communities, such as deaf people/persons with hearing impairments, persons with intellectual disabilities, and persons with psychosocial disabilities. \nInclusive Service Delivery: Among 85 million officially estimated persons with disabilities, 38 million (44.7%) hold a disability certificate as of 2021. The task for service provision is daunting given the huge and diverse demands, and China has reached impressive coverage of services, especially in social protection and rehabilitation. To better align with the CRPD, the next step is to shift the focus from welfare provision to social inclusion, from special needs to inclusive services. This would require better rights awareness, accessibility, and reasonable accommodations in mainstream services, such as health, education, and employment; stronger support for caregiving instead of demanding family responsibilities; and more equitable allocation of resources for marginalized communities, such as persons with disabilities in rural areas, persons with severe or multiple disabilities, women with disabilities, and persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: According to the Ministry of Finance, in 2021, the national public budget expenditure on disability affairs was CNY 70.6 billion, roughly 0.287% of the total national general public budget expenditure. Majority of the disability budget (43.3%) was spent on living and care subsidies. Inclusive services such as inclusive education and employment, as championed by the CRPD, need stronger financial support. \nAccountability and governance: The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recommends an independent mechanism appointed to monitor the implementation of the CRPD. The CDPF regularly collects data from disability certificate holders and publishes annual updates in its key mandates, yet the data is not specifically aligned with the definition of disability or priority areas of the CRPD or SDGs. Data disaggregated by disability in mainstream statistical efforts need enhancement.",

            "Background \nPurpose of analysis \nThe UN Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (PRPD) is dedicated to the implementation of the CRPD, by bringing together different UN entities, governments, persons with disabilities and civil society for the purpose of joint programming and partnerships. To better support countries, the PRPD believes it is necessary to understand what the main bottlenecks and priorities are in each country in relation to the fulfilment of the CRPD. This Situational Analysis was developed as a requirement of the inception phase of the fourth call for proposals of the UNPRPD Multi-Partner Trust Fund (UNPRPD MPTF). Key objectives of the 4 th call include advancing CRPD implementation at country level by focusing on the preconditions for disability inclusion across sectors, and improving the implementation of disability inclusive SDGs at the country level. The main goal of the situational analysis is to inform the design of future cross-sector PRPD programs in China, with the report serving as a baseline. The analysis also aims to build working relationships between UN entities, government, OPDs, other civil society organizations, private sector and academia, as a basis for future co-design of programs; to strengthen the capacity of above stakeholders to include and address the rights of persons with disabilities more effectively; and to inspire disability inclusion adjustments in ongoing UN programs and processes. \nIntroduction to disability in China \nOfficially, China is home to 85 million persons with disabilities, roughly 6% of the total population. The most recent national survey on disability (2006) found that 17.8% of households in China had family members with disabilities. 75.04% of persons with disabilities resided in rural areas, 53.24% were above 60 years old, and 51.55% were men. 2 China ’s Law on the Protection of Disabled Persons (LPPD) defines a person with disabilities as “ one who has abnormalities of loss of a certain organ or function, psychologically or physiologically, or in anatomical structure and has lost wholly or in part the ability to perform an activity in the way considered normal. ” Based on this definition, six categories of disability are certified, including visual disabilities, hearing disabilities, physical disabilities, speech disabilities, intellectual disabilities, and psychiatric disabilities, with four grades under each category.

Information on the effectiveness of the Committee in mainstreaming CRPD across all sectors and levels of government is lacking. 160 There is no independent mechanism appointed to monitor the implementation of the CRPD. 161 \nThe CDPF is the focal point overseeing the implementation of the CRPD, responsible for monitoring whether the creation and implementation of policies and plans relating to the rights of persons with disabilities are consistent with the CRPD principles. Some CSOs were invited to consultations for CRPD reporting but OPDs were underrepresented. 162 Most CSOs involved were specialized associations funded by the CDPF, or service provision organizations led by people without disabilities. In 2018, the State Council Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work published China ’s draft CRPD country report for public opinions, but the time window was fewer than 24 hours, making it impractical for meaningful comments to be incorporated. 163 A few OPDs have engaged in CRPD monitoring through shadow reporting, but most OPDs consulted have not engaged in CRPD monitoring mechanisms. \nChina has completed its combined second and third periodic reports. The review sessions concluded in September 2022. Major findings of the concluding observations suggest that China ’s disability-related policies and laws are not yet fully aligned with the social model of disability, OPDs independent from the state lack meaningful participation in policy-making, and China ’s legal system lacks anti-discrimination frameworks and effective provisions guaranteeing reasonable accommodations. 164 \nIn China ’s National Plan on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 165 disability was explicitly mentioned in China ’s action plan for goal 4 (quality education), 8 (decent work and economic growth), and 10 (reduced inequalities). In China ’s Progress Report on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2021), persons with disabilities were reported as beneficiaries of China ’s progress on SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG4 (quality education), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). 166 Concrete achievements include: \n• “ To ensure the right to education for people with disabilities, the second phase of the Special Educational Enhancement Program was fully completed from 2017 to 2020. By the end of 2020, the enrollment rate of children with disabilities in compulsory education exceeded 95%; a total of 880,800 special education students had been enrolled, 388,800 more than in 2016. ” \n• “ From 2016 to 2020, 1.81 million people with disabilities got employed in urban and rural areas. As of the end of 2020, 2.39 million people with disabilities obtained flexible employment (including community and home employment). ” 167 \nIn China ’s 2021 Voluntary National Review, people with disabilities are mentioned as beneficiaries of China ’s efforts in SDG 1.5, the world ’s largest social security system, and COVID response. No specific evidence was provided regarding the implementation of the disability-related goals listed in China ’s Action Plan. 168",
            "OPDs consulted for the report identified the following key gaps in accessibility as the most urgent: low public awareness of accessibility, weak enforcement of laws and standards, and the lack of participation of persons with disabilities in designing, monitoring, and evaluating accessibility. Expert informants note that enforcement of accessibility policies requires strong inter-ministerial coordination, which DPFs lack sufficient authority for. Awareness of local government leadership and the support of more powerful ministries is crucial. OPDs are also calling for strengthening the digital literacy of persons with disabilities, which is positively correlated with income levels in China. 64 A CDPF joined study found that due to lack of internet access or devices, prohibition by parents, and insufficient skills to use accessibility features, the usage rate of internet among youth with disabilities (aged 10-18) is merely 68%, significantly lower than youth without disabilities (94.9%). 65 While digital tools are important means of production, there lacks systemic assessment of the digital literacy of persons with disabilities. \n4. Inclusive Service Delivery \n4.1 Disability assessment and referral systems \nChina ’s current disability determination system does not align with the CRPD ’s social model definition of disability, or the WHO classification system. The Classification and Grading Criteria for Disability (GB/T 26341-2010) provides national standards for six types of disability, namely visual impairment/blind, Hearing impairment/deaf, Physical disability, Speech disability, Intellectual disability, and Psychiatric disabilities, with four grades under each type. Legal determination of disability is conducted by designated medical institutions, and the recognition of disability comes in the form of a certificate issued by the CDPF, which is a prerequisite for applying for disability subsidies and functions as an identification to access a range of benefits and services. Early i dentification and intervention mechanisms for children aged 0-6 are promoted by the N ational Disability Prevention Action Plan (2021-2025) and the Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities (2017). In 2021, 278,695 children with disabilities received basic rehabilitation services nationwide. 66 Quality of the services, disaggregated by type of disability, location, and gender, needs further assessment. \nPredominantly based on biomedical criteria, the system does not account for the social and environmental factors that affect people ’s capacity to undertake activities of daily life and participation. The determination criteria also prioritize people who could not recover after receiving treatment for over a year, and does not account for temporary impairments. 67 \nThe DPFs regularly update and monitor data of certified persons with disabilities, as basis for service provision and policy making. Among 85 million officially estimated persons with disabilities, only 38 million (44.7%) hold a disability certificate as of 2021, and 57.8% of them are men. 68 The low rate of certificate holding is in part due to stigma, lack of information, inaccessibility of the determination system, and 68中国残疾人联合会.

            "2023 marks the 15 th year since China has ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2008. The landscape of disability inclusion in China has been undergoing deep transformation. This Situational Analysis provides an overview of the five preconditions for disability inclusion, as defined by the United Nations Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNPRPD) — equality and non-discrimination, inclusive service delivery, accessibility, CRPD compliant budgeting, and accountability and governance; and three cross-cutting issues including participation, inequalities, and gender. For each area of inquiry, the analysis follows the research questions provided by the UNPRPD, in identifying the gaps and opportunities to inform future development programs. The analysis is primarily based on secondary literature review, supplemented with consultations, carried out between March 2023 and June 2023. \nEquality and Non-Discrimination: China has more than 80 laws and 50 administrative regulations directly related to the interests of persons with disabilities, and regularly updated its national strategy for disability since 1991. Translating these commitments into better inclusion requires efforts to better align disabilityrelated policies and laws with the social model of disability, meaningfully engage OPDs independent from the state in decision making, and fully implement accessibility, reasonable accommodations, and antidiscrimination provisions. Culturally, the charity or medical model of disability remains dominant in public attitudes. \nAccessibility: China has issued more than 450 regulations, rules and normative documents on accessibility implementation and management. In recent years, campaigns are carried out to improve access to information. A further welcoming development is the new Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, passed on June 28, 2023. The effects of these policies depend on strong enforcement, sufficient remedies, and the meaningful engagement of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessibility tools and rules, with considerations of diverse needs among marginalized communities, such as deaf people/persons with hearing impairments, persons with intellectual disabilities, and persons with psychosocial disabilities. \nInclusive Service Delivery: Among 85 million officially estimated persons with disabilities, 38 million (44.7%) hold a disability certificate as of 2021. The task for service provision is daunting given the huge and diverse demands, and China has reached impressive coverage of services, especially in social protection and rehabilitation. To better align with the CRPD, the next step is to shift the focus from welfare provision to social inclusion, from special needs to inclusive services. This would require better rights awareness, accessibility, and reasonable accommodations in mainstream services, such as health, education, and employment; stronger support for caregiving instead of demanding family responsibilities; and more equitable allocation of resources for marginalized communities, such as persons with disabilities in rural areas, persons with severe or multiple disabilities, women with disabilities, and persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: According to the Ministry of Finance, in 2021, the national public budget expenditure on disability affairs was CNY 70.6 billion, roughly 0.287% of the total national general public budget expenditure. Majority of the disability budget (43.3%) was spent on living and care subsidies. Inclusive services such as inclusive education and employment, as championed by the CRPD, need stronger financial support. \nAccountability and governance: The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recommends an independent mechanism appointed to monitor the implementation of the CRPD. The CDPF regularly collects data from disability certificate holders and publishes annual updates in its key mandates, yet the data is not specifically aligned with the definition of disability or priority areas of the CRPD or SDGs. Data disaggregated by disability in mainstream statistical efforts need enhancement.",
            "Analysis of key gaps and opportunities \nGaps \nEquality and non-discrimination: Attitudinal barriers are considered by stakeholders as one of the most fundamental challenges that cuts across all preconditions for inclusion. Progress has been made since the adoption of CRPD in 2008 in terms of awareness-raising of the social model of disability, especially among development partners and OPDs/CSOs. Yet the Chinese society at large and its corresponding systems are predominantly taking a medical model approach to disability, regarding persons with disabilities as subjects of charity and welfare in need of special rather than mainstream services. Policy makers and service providers, especially at grassroots levels, lack the awareness and buy-in of CRPD or the social model of disability. Laws and regulations relevant to disability are not fully aligned with the CRPD, and lack strength in enforcement and remedies. \nInclusive Service Delivery: The current policy frameworks tend to regard persons with disabilities as welfare beneficiaries more than rights holders. Public provision of disability support services prioritize social protection, subsidies, and rehabilitation, less focused on building support systems for the equal participation of persons with disabilities in society, such as inclusive education and employment. Policy makers are incentivized to maximize service coverage for the large population of persons with disabilities with limited resources, de-emphasizing the quality of services. The agency and autonomy of persons with disabilities is downplayed. As reflected in multi-stakeholder consultations, OPDs are concerned about the policy focus on family ’s responsibility in caregiving for persons with disabilities, without sufficient government support. \nAccessibility: Unchecked discrimination against persons with disabilities, combined with the lack of reasonable accommodations and accessibility, pose consistent barriers in all aspects of social participation of persons with disabilities. Despite increased government investment in accessibility, weak enforcement, insufficient remedies, and the lack of meaningful participation of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessible tools and standards has resulted in the poor quality of accessibility measures. As shown in the draft Law on the Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, there is also a tendency to prioritize physical environment over access to information and service provision, especially for persons with intellectual or psychosocial impairments, and deaf people/persons with hearing impairments. \nAccountability and Governance: Disability has not yet been mainstreamed into the current governance structure. The CDPF system is assigned the responsibility for disability inclusion but with insufficient authority to coordinate with other ministries. This relatively segregated coordination mechanism within the government, according to stakeholders consulted, can form barriers for OPDs to engage mainstream ministries and obtain resources from the government which are concentrated within the DPF system. Consistent data collections on disability inclusion aligned with the CRPD and SDGs are lacking. Official statistics on disability adopt impairment-based definitions of disability and does not comply with the ICF or CRPD definitions of disability. Further, stakeholders are concerned about the reliability of self-reported data, the transparency of data, and the lack of disaggregated data by disability in mainstream data collections. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: Despite the much larger size compared to development partners, government budgeting prioritizes welfare provision over rights protection, and special rather than mainstream services. Significant power and resource imbalances exist between the duty bearers and rights holders. While development partners are reducing support for countries like China as its income level grows, development programs funded by foreign entities are under increasing legal and administrative scrutiny. This has impacted the development of independent OPDs which lack access to government resources.",
            "ll five-year plans for national economic and social development. Government at local levels shall make corresponding implementation plans and incorporate the implementation into government work evaluation. Annual monitoring, mid-term evaluation, concluding evaluation, third-party evaluation, and social satisfaction rate survey of the implementation of the five-year plans, are also stipulated. 41 The latest plan, the 14 th Five-year Plan on the Protection and Development of Persons with Disabilities (2021-2025), focuses on livelihood and employment, social protection, and basic public services. It sets the framework and indicators for implementation, although it is not specifically aligned with the CRPD or SDG plans and programs. \nA key legal harmonization effort, according to UN ESCAP, is “ the revision by China in 2008 of its 1990 law on the protection of persons with disabilities in an effort to incorporate the concepts and principles of the Convention into the legislation. This included a prohibition of disability discrimination, although it did not include definitions of disability or reasonable accommodation championed by the CRPD and did not explicitly state that denial of reasonable accommodation is disability discrimination."

            "Higher education \nHigher education remains largely inaccessible to persons with disabilities. As of 2019, a total of 43,900 persons with disabilities were enrolled in regular college in the entire country, 123 which means roughly 10,000 persons with disabilities graduate from college every year. By contrast, the number of college graduates without disabilities in 2020 was 8.74 million, 124 over 800 times more than persons with disabilities. Barriers faced by persons with disabilities prior to higher education include low primary school enrolment rate among persons with disabilities in rural areas, high dropout rate among children with disabilities, low educational expectation for persons with disabilities due to deeply entrenched stigma, inadequate support in school including reasonable accommodations, and limited options in colleges and majors open to persons with disabilities. 125 Due to continued advocacy, in 2014, a national policy began to allow the application for reasonable accommodations in the national college entrance exam (gaokao), and in 2017, rules on supporting students with disabilities taking regular gaokao were issued. 126 As a result, more students with disabilities were able to attend the exam, but the acceptance rate remains disproportionately low. \nEmployment and livelihood \nThe right to equal employment opportunities is stipulated in China ’s Constitution, the Labor Law, the LPPD, and Regulations on the Employment of Disabled Persons (2007). The Employment Promotion Law (2007) also contains an anti-discrimination provision regarding people with disabilities. 127 As a priority area of China ’s state disability programs, employment is typically included in the national five-year plans for disability. The latest 14 th Five-Year Plan sets goals for diversifying the types and improving the quality of employment of persons with disabilities. In 2022, the State Council adopted the Three-Year Action Plan on Promoting Disability Employment (2022-2024), setting the target of generating one million new jobs for persons with disabilities over three years, creating an important policy momentum. \nAs a form of affirmative action, China has adopted an employment quota scheme, one of the most important policy devices for promoting employment of persons with disabilities. Implemented in the late 1980s, this nationwide, legally binding scheme applies to all public and private sector organizations with a workforce exceeding 30 employees and operating for more than 3 years. It stipulates that at least 1.5% of all public or private entities ’ workforce must be persons with a disability, and non-compliance shall result in financial penalty paid to the Disabled Employment Security Fund (DESF), managed by the CDPF. 128 In practice, the quota policy has been poorly enforced, and even created perverse incentives such as “ fake employment ” practices that rent a disabled person ’s certificate as a token of compliance without real work opportunity. 129 Some OPDs point out that the policy may have caused more disability-based discrimination. 130 Consultations further show the complexity of the issue. Many persons with disabilities, due to systemic education and employment exclusion, end up depending on the income from renting their certificates to private companies. The funding scheme also contains a conflict of interest, as some local governments rely on DESF as a source of revenue, incentivizing officials to collect more fines than promoting real employment. 131",
            "The overall labor participation rate remains low for persons with disabilities. Although official data estimates over half of working-age people with disabilities are employed, 132 about three quarters of these jobs are categorized as either agriculture, cultivation, or “ flexible ” employment, 133 namely temporary or part-time jobs (see Figure 1). Persons with disabilities are significantly less likely to work in higher skilled white-collar occupations. 134 As key targets of poverty alleviation, as of 2018, households of persons with disabilities earned less than 60% of the national average and the gap continues to widen. 135 Among all, persons with intellectual disabilities were least accepted by employers. According to a report based on surveys of 203 families in Guangzhou, only 2% of persons with intellectual disabilities in Guangzhou had meaningful employment. 136 A recent survey of 328 companies shows that 70.4% persons with disabilities hired by these employers are people with physical impairments, and 59.8% are in supporting or administrative roles. 137 \n131 In consultation, informants have identified multiple systemic barriers to inclusive employment, including: \n• inadequate access to equal education opportunities, including the lack of high-quality basic education, as well as vocational training and skill development opportunities for persons with disabilities; \n• the lack of anti-discrimination and disability mainstreaming laws and policies; \n• lack of public sector role models for disability-inclusive employment; \n• lack of disability inclusion expertise among employment service providers; \n• discriminatory social attitudes towards persons with disabilities by families and friends, employers, co-workers, and even persons with disabilities themselves; \n• Lack of accessibility and reasonable accommodations to and at workplaces. \nILO ’s Global Business and Disability Network (GBDN) China Chapter has made progress in influencing the private sector to recruit and include persons with disabilities. While attracting local companies to join GBDN-China and promoting inclusive employment practices remains a challenge, GBDN-China presents an opportunity to generate good practices and share experiences with other companies in China.",

            "7. Cross cutting issues \n7.1 Participation \nWithin the government system, there exist formal mechanisms to facilitate OPD participation in policymaking and decision-making. For instance, the Disabled People ’s Representative Congress, which is meant to function as the disabled persons ’ equivalent of the National People ’s Congress, represents the highest power overseeing the CDPF and is required to reserve at least half of its seats to persons with disabilities and their families/friends. 171 The five specialized associations, predominantly functioning as internal parts of the DPFs, are dedicated to serving the interests of people with the kinds of disabilities they represent, and are usually headed by people with the same kinds of disabilities or their families/friends. The CDPF also encourages more persons with disabilities and their families/friends to become NPC and CPPCC delegates. \n167 Ibid. \nOPDs independent from the government are involved in policy-making and decision-making to a much less extent, as consultations show. Most laws and regulations concerning disability pass without the formal input of non-state affiliated OPDs. An exception is the recent draft Law on Construction of BarrierFree Environments. The draft law was open for public comments in 2022 and 2023, and multiple OPDs organized public consultations and submitted comments. Results of their advocacy remain to be seen. Despite the lack of formal engagement, some independent OPDs have leveraged informal channels through key decision-makers, academics, NPC and CPPCC delegates to influence policy and law making. For instance, informants note that the inclusion of accessibility provisions in the Legal Aid Law was achieved through OPD collaboration with academic think tanks. \nConsultations show that formal mechanisms for participation tend to be highly selective, and exclusively accessed by CSOs, OPDs, or individuals with disabilities that are affiliated with or endorsed by the government, who take a rather service-oriented than rights-based approach. Most formal mechanisms are symbolic. As informants comment, meaningful dialogues are difficult due to power imbalances, and a lack of recognition of OPDs ’ leadership in disability inclusion. Meanwhile, the effect of informal mechanisms is not guaranteed, and depends highly on personal circumstances and political opportunities. Most grassroots OPDs, in reality, lack access to such mechanisms. Comprehensive assessment of different approaches for OPDs to influence decision making is not available, and is worthy of future research. \nAccording to various stakeholders, key areas of improvement for OPDs to make engagement with duty bearers include: better knowledge of existing policies; more access to official channels; stronger coordination between OPDs and policy makers/advocates (such as think thanks, scholars, and NPC/CPPCC representatives); higher awareness of the expertise and capacity of OPDs; and mechanisms that prioritizes the voices of independent OPDs.",
            "By 2017, China has issued 451 regulations, rules and normative documents on accessibility implementation and management. 44 The main regulation on accessibility is the Regulations on the Construction of Barrier-free Environments (2012), which stipulate that the construction and modification of roads, public buildings, public transport facilities, residential buildings and residential areas shall comply with the construction standards for barrier-free facilities. China also incorporated barrier-free construction into its national development plans, such as the Implementation Programme for Construction of Barrier-Free Environments during the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (2016 –2020), and the National Plan on New Urbanization (2014 –2020). National accessibility standards (GB 50763-2012) have also been adopted. Comprehensive data about the application of the technical standards are unavailable and should be addressed by future research. Accessibility is not yet mainstreamed into public procurement, according to government informants consulted. \nIn recent years, more attention has been paid to the accessibility of information and communications. In 2020, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and CDPF issued the Guiding Opinions on Promoting Information Accessibility, focusing on removing barriers of the affordability, devices, and services of information for persons with disabilities. 45 On 5 February 2022, China ratified the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled. In 2021, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology launched a whole year Action Plan to modify the accessibility of internet applications for elderly people and persons with disabilities, mitigating “ digital divides. ” 46 The Action Plan explicitly listed 158 websites and applications targeted for modification, ranging from those of governments, news outlets, airlines and railways, social media, and e-commerce, to search engines, banks, travel agencies, health services. By 2022, over 800 government entities modified their web accessibility, 320 websites passed an accessibility audit, and nearly 100 applications added accessibility features such as large fonts, high contrast, and easy to read pages. 47 The provision of accessible services such as sign language interpretation are mentioned in the Rule on the Construction of Accessible Environment, Guiding Opinions on Strengthening the Construction of Broadcasting and Television Public Service System, and National Basic Public Service Standards. China has also issued its Second National Sign Language and Braille Standardization Action Plan (2021-2025), and the Promotion Plan for National Universal Sign Language. \nIn 2022, the draft Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments solicited public opinions. The second draft was released for public comments in April 2023. The legislation is widely recognized as a catalytic opportunity for raising the awareness of accessibility, and specifying the implementation measures at the local level. Expert informants involved in the legislative process praised the draft law for emphasizing accessibility at the planning stage, and legally recognizing the universal benefits of accessibility. Controversies remain about how strict the enforcement will be. OPDs are concerned about the lack of clarity on accountability and remedies, 48 the insufficient attention to the needs of persons with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities, 49 and the significant room for discretion for duty-bearers to not comply with the law, 50 making it a symbolic law with “ no teeth. ”",
            "7. To establish meaningful mechanisms to enhance OPD participation and amplify the voices of persons with disabilities in UN supported programmes. For instance, within the UNPRPD program, pilot test a mechanism for OPDs to partner with scholars/CSOs/think tanks/associations on evidence-based policy advocacy. The latter stakeholders can function as intermediaries between grassroots OPDs and policy makers. The collaboration mechanism should combine OPDs ’ disability-specific expertise, with the allies ’ domain-specific expertise and government access (e.g. education, health/SRHR, employment, or accessibility), and produce joint products for policy advocacy (e.g. reports, policy proposals, internal briefings, or pilot programs). The mechanism should fully leverage OPDs ’ leadership and expertise in analyzing community needs, while strengthening OPDs ’ policy advocacy skills and local-level support networks. It should also serve to increase the disability inclusion awareness and capabilities of domain experts. OPDs shall play a leading role in the mechanism, with sufficient decision-making power at each stage of the project, rather than mere data collectors. The UN should aim for creating opportunities for de-bureaucratized, informal engagement among stakeholders. \n8. To strengthen the resources and capacity for grassroots OPDs to participate in policy making, implementation, and monitoring in UN funded programmes. This could serve as models of good practice for other local programmes. Leverage the UNPRPD program and platforms such as the UNTGD, to facilitate regular knowledge exchanges among OPDs and stakeholders on successful engagement with existing participation mechanisms. These can include best practices of partnering with governmenttrusted think tanks for policy advocacy, submitting proposals to the NPC and CPPCC sessions, engagement strategies with government entities, campaigns for mobilizing public comments on draft legislations, monitoring the implementation of accessibility standards, participation in UN human rights treaty mechanisms, and effective collaboration with the private sector. The UN should provide a safe space and allocate sufficient resources to ensure OPDs and individuals with disabilities with less access can benefit. \n9. To create platforms for capacity building and international exchange for grassroots OPDs. Although development funding is negligible compared to the scale of government budget on disability, resources for OPDs remain scarce. OPDs operating in similar social and economic contexts can share ideas and build peer-support networks. It can also increase the visibility of Chinese OPDs at the international level and share Chinese best practices with other countries. \n10. To prioritize women with disabilities and marginalized communities in the design of the PRPD program. Prioritize the leadership of women with disabilities in development programs, and support gender-sensitive approaches to disability programs, rather than merely including female participants in activities. Allocate sufficient financial and human resources to support the meaningful participation of marginalized communities, such as travel, lodging, personal assistance, and reasonable accommodations. \n11. To enhance disability and gender mutual mainstreaming within the UN system. The 2022 Disability Inclusion Scorecard Assessment shows that the UNCT still fall short in meeting Indicator 8 “ Joint programmes: Joint programmes contribute to disability inclusion ” and Indicator 9 “ Data: Strengthening data on persons with disabilities. ” OPDs expect the UN to further implement the United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy, and model best practices such as incorporating disability components, indicators, and OPDs in non-disability focused UN programs, employing persons with disabilities, enhancing the accessibility of UN offices and meetings, and increasing the collection and disclosure of data disaggregated by types of disability, degrees of disability, and location of persons with disabilities. \nwww.UNPRPD.org",
            "Analysis of key gaps and opportunities \nGaps \nEquality and non-discrimination: Attitudinal barriers are considered by stakeholders as one of the most fundamental challenges that cuts across all preconditions for inclusion. Progress has been made since the adoption of CRPD in 2008 in terms of awareness-raising of the social model of disability, especially among development partners and OPDs/CSOs. Yet the Chinese society at large and its corresponding systems are predominantly taking a medical model approach to disability, regarding persons with disabilities as subjects of charity and welfare in need of special rather than mainstream services. Policy makers and service providers, especially at grassroots levels, lack the awareness and buy-in of CRPD or the social model of disability. Laws and regulations relevant to disability are not fully aligned with the CRPD, and lack strength in enforcement and remedies. \nInclusive Service Delivery: The current policy frameworks tend to regard persons with disabilities as welfare beneficiaries more than rights holders. Public provision of disability support services prioritize social protection, subsidies, and rehabilitation, less focused on building support systems for the equal participation of persons with disabilities in society, such as inclusive education and employment. Policy makers are incentivized to maximize service coverage for the large population of persons with disabilities with limited resources, de-emphasizing the quality of services. The agency and autonomy of persons with disabilities is downplayed. As reflected in multi-stakeholder consultations, OPDs are concerned about the policy focus on family ’s responsibility in caregiving for persons with disabilities, without sufficient government support. \nAccessibility: Unchecked discrimination against persons with disabilities, combined with the lack of reasonable accommodations and accessibility, pose consistent barriers in all aspects of social participation of persons with disabilities. Despite increased government investment in accessibility, weak enforcement, insufficient remedies, and the lack of meaningful participation of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessible tools and standards has resulted in the poor quality of accessibility measures. As shown in the draft Law on the Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, there is also a tendency to prioritize physical environment over access to information and service provision, especially for persons with intellectual or psychosocial impairments, and deaf people/persons with hearing impairments. \nAccountability and Governance: Disability has not yet been mainstreamed into the current governance structure. The CDPF system is assigned the responsibility for disability inclusion but with insufficient authority to coordinate with other ministries. This relatively segregated coordination mechanism within the government, according to stakeholders consulted, can form barriers for OPDs to engage mainstream ministries and obtain resources from the government which are concentrated within the DPF system. Consistent data collections on disability inclusion aligned with the CRPD and SDGs are lacking. Official statistics on disability adopt impairment-based definitions of disability and does not comply with the ICF or CRPD definitions of disability. Further, stakeholders are concerned about the reliability of self-reported data, the transparency of data, and the lack of disaggregated data by disability in mainstream data collections. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: Despite the much larger size compared to development partners, government budgeting prioritizes welfare provision over rights protection, and special rather than mainstream services. Significant power and resource imbalances exist between the duty bearers and rights holders. While development partners are reducing support for countries like China as its income level grows, development programs funded by foreign entities are under increasing legal and administrative scrutiny. This has impacted the development of independent OPDs which lack access to government resources.",
            "eview and implementation of the UNSDCF will be made at the level of the Results Groups. \nSpecifically, under the UNSDCF Strategic Priority 1 “ People and Prosperity: Achieving innovation-driven, coordinated and shared development ”, Outcome 2 reads, “ People ’s lives in China are improved further as headways is made in ensuring access to childcare, education, healthcare services, elderly care, housing, and social assistance, and more people in China, including left-behind groups, benefit from equitable and high quality public services and social protection systems as well as accelerated efforts to reduced gender inequality and other forms of social inequality throughout the life-course. ” \nThe UN makes an effort to engage persons with disabilities and their representative organizations closely across ongoing programs at country level. One attempt was to make the UN premises more accessible. An assessment on the accessibility of the physical environment and services of all UN premises in China has been completed with support of the Accessibility Development Institute of Tsinghua University in 2021, with detailed recommendations provided for improvement. \nUNTGD provides a platform for international development partners to engage with OPDs. Currently, a few bilateral and multilateral donors such as the European Commission and British Council still have programs on disability. However, consultations show that international cooperation is increasingly scrutinized by authorities, and OPDs and local stakeholders are cautious about such engagement. \n1.6 Other Key Stakeholders (Academic, Private sector): Academic institutions or think tanks play an important role in the sector, due to their access to policy making channels. However, not all academics are aligned with the CRPD. OPDs are concerned that some academic institutions regard disability as an object of research but do not meaningfully engage OPDs, displacing rather than amplifying the voices of persons with disabilities. \nPrivate sector is increasingly active in disability inclusion, due to shifting funding structure for OPDs/CSOs, domestic policy incentives for disability-inclusive employment and services, and global corporate cultural change towa"

            "A decade later, women with disabilities face continued barriers in care, marriage and social life, reproductive health care, and equal opportunities to employment, as shown in a women ’s OPD survey of 535 women with disabilities. 187 Another recent multi-year OPD survey of 1,083 women with disabilities reveals that as high as 33% of them were once told to discontinue their education. Among educated informants, 24% experienced dropout because of their disability. 54.3% of women studied were not employed, for whom caretaking responsibilities and unsuccessful job seeking are the main reasons. Over half of the women reported experiences of rejection for job opportunities because of their disability, and 34.4% because of their gender. Most working women, on the other hand, received no support on workplace accessibility and reasonable accommodation, and 44.7% of them did not receive equal pay for equal work. Over half of the informants reported personal income as lower than CNY 2000 per month. 36.3% of women surveyed in 2020 experienced loss of income due to COVID-19. 188 \nIn 2020, the CDPF, supported by UN ESCAP, UN Women, UNFPA, and Rehabilitation International, released a “ Call to Action: Enabling Sisters with Disabilities to Join in Shaping the Future We Want ” in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action at the Fourth World Conference on Women, and the fifth year of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Promoting adequate standard of living, health, and education of women and girls with disabilities are among the top of the list of call for actions. Sexual and reproductive health is considered a key entry point of intervention for women and LGBTI persons with disabilities by consulted stakeholders, which, in the context of China, connects cross-cutting issues of healthcare, education, employment, accessibility, anti-violence, and rights awareness raising for persons with disabilities. \n8. Disability Inclusion in Broader Development, Humanitarian & Emergency Contexts \n8.1 National Development Plans \nIn China ’s National Plan on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 189 disability was explicitly mentioned in China ’s action plan for goal 4 (quality education), 8 (decent work and economic growth), and 10 (reduced inequalities). Specifically, China ’s actions plans with explicit reference to disability include: \n• SDG 4.2: Improve the funding system for preschool education to help the less-privileged, such as children from needy families, orphans and children with disabilities, to gain access to public preschool education. Improve the quality of kindergarten teachers \n• SDG 4.5: Protect everyone ’s right including that of vulnerable groups to education, and improve special education. Open special education schools in counties with more than 300,000 residents and gradually ensure 12-year free education for children with disabilities, covering the 9-year compulsory education and the senior high school education. \n• SDG 8.5: Increase labor force participation rate through implementation of the classification policy. Vigorously enforce the Law on Promotion of Employment. Targeted measures have been formulated to promote employment of university graduates, migrant workers, people with disabilities, retired soldiers, women and some other groups. Improve employment and entrepreneurship services and launch a lifelong vocational training initiative.",
            "• SDG 8.10: Implement the Plan for Promoting the Development of Financial Inclusion(2016-2020) to establish, by 2020, an inclusive financial services and security system to increase the accessibility of timely, affordable, and convenient financial services for the general public, especially for small and micro enterprises, farmers, urban low-incomers, poor people, people with disabilities and the elderly. By 2020, establish a modern insurance industry that is comprehensive, stable, well-functioning and credible. \n• SDG 10.3: Establish a more equitable and sustainable social protection system that better protect rights and interests of vulnerable social groups such as women, minors, and people with disabilities. \nIn China ’s Progress Report on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2021), persons with disabilities were reported as beneficiaries of China ’s progress on SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG4 (quality education), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). 190 In China ’s 2021 Voluntary National Review, people with disabilities are mentioned as beneficiaries of China ’s efforts in SDG 1.5, the world ’s largest social security system, and COVID response. No specific evidence was provided regarding the implementation of the disability-related goals listed in China ’s Action Plan. 191 There is no reference to OPD participation or capacity development support of OPDs in the Action Plan, Progress Report, or Voluntary National Review. \nThe UNSDCF (2021-2025) with China included disability-related support in “ Outcome 2: People ’s lives in China are improved further as headway is made in ensuring access to childcare, education, healthcare services, elderly care, housing, and social assistance, and more people in China, including left-behind groups, benefit from equitable and high-quality public services and social protection systems as well as accelerated efforts to reduce gender inequality and other forms of social inequality throughout the lifecourse. ” 192 The UNTGD is fully consulted in the country plans and strategies, processes and reporting. Other bilateral agencies and donors promote and engage in disability rights through their participation in the UNTGD meetings and activities, but most from disability-specific rather than disability mainstreaming perspectives.",
            "Background \nPurpose of analysis \nThe UN Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (PRPD) is dedicated to the implementation of the CRPD, by bringing together different UN entities, governments, persons with disabilities and civil society for the purpose of joint programming and partnerships. To better support countries, the PRPD believes it is necessary to understand what the main bottlenecks and priorities are in each country in relation to the fulfilment of the CRPD. This Situational Analysis was developed as a requirement of the inception phase of the fourth call for proposals of the UNPRPD Multi-Partner Trust Fund (UNPRPD MPTF). Key objectives of the 4 th call include advancing CRPD implementation at country level by focusing on the preconditions for disability inclusion across sectors, and improving the implementation of disability inclusive SDGs at the country level. The main goal of the situational analysis is to inform the design of future cross-sector PRPD programs in China, with the report serving as a baseline. The analysis also aims to build working relationships between UN entities, government, OPDs, other civil society organizations, private sector and academia, as a basis for future co-design of programs; to strengthen the capacity of above stakeholders to include and address the rights of persons with disabilities more effectively; and to inspire disability inclusion adjustments in ongoing UN programs and processes. \nIntroduction to disability in China \nOfficially, China is home to 85 million persons with disabilities, roughly 6% of the total population. The most recent national survey on disability (2006) found that 17.8% of households in China had family members with disabilities. 75.04% of persons with disabilities resided in rural areas, 53.24% were above 60 years old, and 51.55% were men. 2 China ’s Law on the Protection of Disabled Persons (LPPD) defines a person with disabilities as “ one who has abnormalities of loss of a certain organ or function, psychologically or physiologically, or in anatomical structure and has lost wholly or in part the ability to perform an activity in the way considered normal. ” Based on this definition, six categories of disability are certified, including visual disabilities, hearing disabilities, physical disabilities, speech disabilities, intellectual disabilities, and psychiatric disabilities, with four grades under each category. By 2021, 38 million persons with disabilities held a disability certificate, among whom 22 million were men, and 30.1 million were registered as rural residents. 3 Among the disability certificate holders, 18.7% were illiterate, 40.3% received primary education, and 30.3% went to middle school. 4 \nThe China Disabled Persons Federation (CDPF), a semi-governmental mass organization with vice-ministry level status, was founded in 1988, marking significant national commitment to disability issues. 5 The CDPF ’s mission is to “ represent, serve, and manage ” persons with disabilities across China. 6 By 2018, a 4中国残疾人联合会.

            "2023 marks the 15 th year since China has ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2008. The landscape of disability inclusion in China has been undergoing deep transformation. This Situational Analysis provides an overview of the five preconditions for disability inclusion, as defined by the United Nations Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNPRPD) — equality and non-discrimination, inclusive service delivery, accessibility, CRPD compliant budgeting, and accountability and governance; and three cross-cutting issues including participation, inequalities, and gender. For each area of inquiry, the analysis follows the research questions provided by the UNPRPD, in identifying the gaps and opportunities to inform future development programs. The analysis is primarily based on secondary literature review, supplemented with consultations, carried out between March 2023 and June 2023. \nEquality and Non-Discrimination: China has more than 80 laws and 50 administrative regulations directly related to the interests of persons with disabilities, and regularly updated its national strategy for disability since 1991. Translating these commitments into better inclusion requires efforts to better align disabilityrelated policies and laws with the social model of disability, meaningfully engage OPDs independent from the state in decision making, and fully implement accessibility, reasonable accommodations, and antidiscrimination provisions. Culturally, the charity or medical model of disability remains dominant in public attitudes. \nAccessibility: China has issued more than 450 regulations, rules and normative documents on accessibility implementation and management. In recent years, campaigns are carried out to improve access to information. A further welcoming development is the new Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, passed on June 28, 2023. The effects of these policies depend on strong enforcement, sufficient remedies, and the meaningful engagement of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessibility tools and rules, with considerations of diverse needs among marginalized communities, such as deaf people/persons with hearing impairments, persons with intellectual disabilities, and persons with psychosocial disabilities. \nInclusive Service Delivery: Among 85 million officially estimated persons with disabilities, 38 million (44.7%) hold a disability certificate as of 2021. The task for service provision is daunting given the huge and diverse demands, and China has reached impressive coverage of services, especially in social protection and rehabilitation. To better align with the CRPD, the next step is to shift the focus from welfare provision to social inclusion, from special needs to inclusive services. This would require better rights awareness, accessibility, and reasonable accommodations in mainstream services, such as health, education, and employment; stronger support for caregiving instead of demanding family responsibilities; and more equitable allocation of resources for marginalized communities, such as persons with disabilities in rural areas, persons with severe or multiple disabilities, women with disabilities, and persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: According to the Ministry of Finance, in 2021, the national public budget expenditure on disability affairs was CNY 70.6 billion, roughly 0.287% of the total national general public budget expenditure. Majority of the disability budget (43.3%) was spent on living and care subsidies. Inclusive services such as inclusive education and employment, as championed by the CRPD, need stronger financial support. \nAccountability and governance: The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recommends an independent mechanism appointed to monitor the implementation of the CRPD. The CDPF regularly collects data from disability certificate holders and publishes annual updates in its key mandates, yet the data is not specifically aligned with the definition of disability or priority areas of the CRPD or SDGs. Data disaggregated by disability in mainstream statistical efforts need enhancement.",

            "8.2 Disaster risk reduction & humanitarian action \nDisability perspective has not been mainstreamed into China ’s disaster risk reduction (DRR) system. China ’s current Emergency Response Law has no specific provisions regarding targeted protections for vulnerable populations, including children, elderly people, and people with disabilities. 193 Article 70 of the Law on Protecting Against and Mitigating Earthquake Disasters requires post-disaster reconstruction to coordinate with the construction of accessible facilities, but the Law does not make explicit reference to the protection of persons with disabilities. 194 \nChina does have a few disability-specific policy directives that included DRR concerns. For instance, the Opinion on Strengthening Social Assistance for Persons with Disabilities, issued by CDPF in 2015, called for meeting the basic needs of persons with disabilities affected by disasters. 195 China ’s regulations and national plans on “ disability prevention ” also set the reduction of disaster-induced disabilities as targets. As a result, the disability-related tasks assigned to China ’s Ministry of Emergency Management is more aimed at preventing disability, less so at providing disability-inclusive services. 196",
            "As COVID-19 heightened the lack of disability-inclusivity in China ’s emergency response system, Zhang Haidi, Chairwoman of CDPF, in her capacity as the Standing Committee Member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, raised policy recommendations that DRR related laws and policies should specify the protection of persons with disabilities and include accessibility, emergency information and DRR facilities should be made accessible, and the capacity of DRR service providers in protecting persons with disabilities should be strengthened. 197 Article 34 of China ’s Civil Code stipulates temporary caregiving services for people whose legal guardians are unavailable during emergencies. This is regarded as an advocacy success by OPDs, triggered by the tragic death of a 16-yearold teenager with cerebral palsy, a week after he was left unattended due to caregivers being taken to COVID-19 quarantine in early 2020. 198 In general, OPDs are not regularly consulted within the civil protection system or humanitarian system in planning and implementation of DRR/humanitarian efforts. \n8.3 Climate Change \nThe 2020 China Report of the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change pointed out disproportionate health risks posed by climate change on those living in poverty, with social disadvantages, and older people ( ≥65 years old). For instance, people above 65 years old face a 10.4% higher risk of dying in a heatwave, the mortality of which has risen by a factor of four from 1990 to 2019. 199 Demographically, these groups significantly overlap with China ’s persons with disabilities. \nDespite the urgency, persons with disabilities or OPDs are in general not included in climate change analyses, plans and programmes in China. In turn, OPDs and disability CSOs do not generally work on climate change issues. Occasionally, OPDs have mobilized and provided targeted community support during climate change related emergencies. For instance, when a severe flooding hit Henan Province in 2021, deaf persons led organization Know Deaf published guidelines for effectively rescuing people with 31726277.html \ndifferent kinds of disabilities during floods. 200 Systemic coordination between climate change and disability programs is lacking.",
            "6.2 National accountability mechanisms \nOfficially, the State Council Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work is responsible for promoting the implementation of the CRPD. Information on the effectiveness of the Committee in mainstreaming CRPD across all sectors and levels of government is lacking. 160 There is no independent mechanism appointed to monitor the implementation of the CRPD. 161 \nThe CDPF is the focal point overseeing the implementation of the CRPD, responsible for monitoring whether the creation and implementation of policies and plans relating to the rights of persons with disabilities are consistent with the CRPD principles. Some CSOs were invited to consultations for CRPD reporting but OPDs were underrepresented. 162 Most CSOs involved were specialized associations funded by the CDPF, or service provision organizations led by people without disabilities. In 2018, the State Council Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work published China ’s draft CRPD country report for public opinions, but the time window was fewer than 24 hours, making it impractical for meaningful comments to be incorporated. 163 A few OPDs have engaged in CRPD monitoring through shadow reporting, but most OPDs consulted have not engaged in CRPD monitoring mechanisms. \nChina has completed its combined second and third periodic reports. The review sessions concluded in September 2022. Major findings of the concluding observations suggest that China ’s disability-related policies and laws are not yet fully aligned with the social model of disability, OPDs independent from the state lack meaningful participation in policy-making, and China ’s legal system lacks anti-discrimination frameworks and effective provisions guaranteeing reasonable accommodations. 164 \nIn China ’s National Plan on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 165 disability was explicitly mentioned in China ’s action plan for goal 4 (quality education), 8 (decent work and economic growth), and 10 (reduced inequalities). In China ’s Progress Report on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2021), persons with disabilities were reported as beneficiaries of China ’s progress on SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG4 (quality education), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). 166 Concrete achievements include: \n• “ To ensure the right to education for people with disabilities, the second phase of the Special Educational Enhancement Program was fully completed from 2017 to 2020. By the end of 2020, the enrollment rate of children with disabilities in compulsory education exceeded 95%; a total of 880,800 special education students had been enrolled, 388,800 more than in 2016. ” \n• “ From 2016 to 2020, 1.81 million people with disabilities got employed in urban and rural areas. As of the end of 2020, 2.39 million people with disabilities obtained flexible employment (including community and home employment). ” 167 \nIn China ’s 2021 Voluntary National Review, people with disabilities are mentioned as beneficiaries of China ’s efforts in SDG 1.5, the world ’s largest social security system, and COVID response.

            "China has regularly updated its national strategy for disability since 1991, in the form of five-year development plans.

            "Analysis of key gaps and opportunities \nGaps \nEquality and non-discrimination: Attitudinal barriers are considered by stakeholders as one of the most fundamental challenges that cuts across all preconditions for inclusion. Progress has been made since the adoption of CRPD in 2008 in terms of awareness-raising of the social model of disability, especially among development partners and OPDs/CSOs. Yet the Chinese society at large and its corresponding systems are predominantly taking a medical model approach to disability, regarding persons with disabilities as subjects of charity and welfare in need of special rather than mainstream services. Policy makers and service providers, especially at grassroots levels, lack the awareness and buy-in of CRPD or the social model of disability. Laws and regulations relevant to disability are not fully aligned with the CRPD, and lack strength in enforcement and remedies. \nInclusive Service Delivery: The current policy frameworks tend to regard persons with disabilities as welfare beneficiaries more than rights holders. Public provision of disability support services prioritize social protection, subsidies, and rehabilitation, less focused on building support systems for the equal participation of persons with disabilities in society, such as inclusive education and employment. Policy makers are incentivized to maximize service coverage for the large population of persons with disabilities with limited resources, de-emphasizing the quality of services. The agency and autonomy of persons with disabilities is downplayed. As reflected in multi-stakeholder consultations, OPDs are concerned about the policy focus on family ’s responsibility in caregiving for persons with disabilities, without sufficient government support. \nAccessibility: Unchecked discrimination against persons with disabilities, combined with the lack of reasonable accommodations and accessibility, pose consistent barriers in all aspects of social participation of persons with disabilities. Despite increased government investment in accessibility, weak enforcement, insufficient remedies, and the lack of meaningful participation of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessible tools and standards has resulted in the poor quality of accessibility measures. As shown in the draft Law on the Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, there is also a tendency to prioritize physical environment over access to information and service provision, especially for persons with intellectual or psychosocial impairments, and deaf people/persons with hearing impairments. \nAccountability and Governance: Disability has not yet been mainstreamed into the current governance structure. The CDPF system is assigned the responsibility for disability inclusion but with insufficient authority to coordinate with other ministries. This relatively segregated coordination mechanism within the government, according to stakeholders consulted, can form barriers for OPDs to engage mainstream ministries and obtain resources from the government which are concentrated within the DPF system. Consistent data collections on disability inclusion aligned with the CRPD and SDGs are lacking. Official statistics on disability adopt impairment-based definitions of disability and does not comply with the ICF or CRPD definitions of disability. Further, stakeholders are concerned about the reliability of self-reported data, the transparency of data, and the lack of disaggregated data by disability in mainstream data collections. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: Despite the much larger size compared to development partners, government budgeting prioritizes welfare provision over rights protection, and special rather than mainstream services. Significant power and resource imbalances exist between the duty bearers and rights holders. While development partners are reducing support for countries like China as its income level grows, development programs funded by foreign entities are under increasing legal and administrative scrutiny. This has impacted the development of independent OPDs which lack access to government resources.",
            "2. Equality and non-discrimination \n2.1 Legislative and policy context \nChina has ratified the CRPD in 2008, without ratifying its Optional Protocol. Under Article 35 of the CRPD, China completed its first periodic report in 2012, and second and third combined in 2018. Review of the latest report concluded in September 2022. On 5 February 2022, China ratified the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled. Other international human rights treaties that China ratified include Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), Convention against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), and International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD). 31 Reporting for CEDAW and CRC typically include references to persons with disabilities. \nOfficially, China has more than 80 laws and 50 administrative regulations directly related to the interests of persons with disabilities. 32 The main legislation stipulating the rights of persons with disabilities in China is the Law on the Protection of Disabled Persons (LPPD), first enacted in 1990 and amended in 2008 in anticipation of the CRPD ratification. Legal experts point out that significant gaps still exist between the 2008 LPPD and the CRPD, including, but not limited to, the lack of provisions of reasonable accommodation, equal recognition before law, and full inclusion of women and children with disabilities, and the law ’s prioritization of prevention and rehabilitation of disability based on medical definitions of disability. 33 A crucial gap lies in the difference in definitions of disability between the LPPD and CRPD, leading to different approaches to addressing disability-related issues. The LPPD (2008) defines a person with disabilities as “ one who has abnormalities of loss of a certain organ or function, psychologically or physiologically, or in anatomical structure and has lost wholly or in part the ability to perform an activity in the way considered normal. ” 34 \nIn addition to the LPPD, major legislations include the 2017 Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities, the 2017 Regulations on the Education of Persons with Disabilities, the Regulations on the Employment of the Disabled, and the 2012 Regulations on the Construction of Barrier-free Environments, 35 and the 2012 Mental Health Law. China ’s first Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments solicited public comments for drafts in 2022 and 2023, and was passed on June 28, 2023, which presents a key policy window for accessibility advocacy. \nChina does not have a general anti-discrimination framework or legislation, 36 although disability related laws are “ against disability-based discrimination ” in principle. The current laws and policies do not have a clear definition of disability-based discrimination, making it difficult for judicial determination of discrimination. 37 The provision of reasonable accommodation is not yet included in all relevant laws and policies, and lacks clear guidance on implementation and effective remedies. 38 As a step forward, some local regulations began explicitly referencing reasonable accommodations. 39 Major progress was made in the national college entrance examination (gaokao) system. Since 2014, there has been policy development for students with disabilities to apply for reasonable accommodations to take gaokao. Statistics show that, in 2017, 5626 students with disabilities applied for reasonable accommodation for gaokao. Advocates call for expanding such progress to more areas such as exams for public servants, high school entrance exams, and judicial exams. 40",
            "6.2 National accountability mechanisms \nOfficially, the State Council Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work is responsible for promoting the implementation of the CRPD. Information on the effectiveness of the Committee in mainstreaming CRPD across all sectors and levels of government is lacking. 160 There is no independent mechanism appointed to monitor the implementation of the CRPD. 161 \nThe CDPF is the focal point overseeing the implementation of the CRPD, responsible for monitoring whether the creation and implementation of policies and plans relating to the rights of persons with disabilities are consistent with the CRPD principles. Some CSOs were invited to consultations for CRPD reporting but OPDs were underrepresented. 162 Most CSOs involved were specialized associations funded by the CDPF, or service provision organizations led by people without disabilities. In 2018, the State Council Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work published China ’s draft CRPD country report for public opinions, but the time window was fewer than 24 hours, making it impractical for meaningful comments to be incorporated. 163 A few OPDs have engaged in CRPD monitoring through shadow reporting, but most OPDs consulted have not engaged in CRPD monitoring mechanisms. \nChina has completed its combined second and third periodic reports. The review sessions concluded in September 2022. Major findings of the concluding observations suggest that China ’s disability-related policies and laws are not yet fully aligned with the social model of disability, OPDs independent from the state lack meaningful participation in policy-making, and China ’s legal system lacks anti-discrimination frameworks and effective provisions guaranteeing reasonable accommodations. 164 \nIn China ’s National Plan on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 165 disability was explicitly mentioned in China ’s action plan for goal 4 (quality education), 8 (decent work and economic growth), and 10 (reduced inequalities). In China ’s Progress Report on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2021), persons with disabilities were reported as beneficiaries of China ’s progress on SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG4 (quality education), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). 166 Concrete achievements include: \n• “ To ensure the right to education for people with disabilities, the second phase of the Special Educational Enhancement Program was fully completed from 2017 to 2020. By the end of 2020, the enrollment rate of children with disabilities in compulsory education exceeded 95%; a total of 880,800 special education students had been enrolled, 388,800 more than in 2016. ” \n• “ From 2016 to 2020, 1.81 million people with disabilities got employed in urban and rural areas. As of the end of 2020, 2.39 million people with disabilities obtained flexible employment (including community and home employment). ” 167 \nIn China ’s 2021 Voluntary National Review, people with disabilities are mentioned as beneficiaries of China ’s efforts in SDG 1.5, the world ’s largest social security system, and COVID response. No specific evidence was provided regarding the implementation of the disability-related goals listed in China ’s Action Plan. 168",
            "Approach \nGuiding principles \nTaking a rights-based approach rooted in the CRPD, this report follows the UNPRPD ’s framework of five preconditions for disability inclusion, namely, equality and non-discrimination, inclusive service delivery, accessibility, CRPD compliant budgeting, and accountability and governance; and three cross-cutting issues including participation, inequalities, and gender. \nThe research team follows the principle “ nothing about us without us ” in the design, implementation, and consultations of the situational analysis, ensuring the direct involvement of national and local organizations of persons with disabilities (OPDs), unofficial self-help groups of persons with disabilities, as well as individuals with disabilities. The core research team consists of members of a national OPD and an individual consultant in close coordination with the UNPRPD Taskforce in China, comprised of UNESCO, ILO, UNFPA, UN Women, and WHO. \nDespite time constraints, the research team strived to leverage the analysis as an opportunity to enhance relationships with and among stakeholders, bringing together government stakeholders, UNCT, and OPD leaders since the work plan design phase. Drafts of the report were sent to the UNCT, key government stakeholders, and OPDs for review, to ensure they are informed and involved in the analysis process. \nMethodology \nThis report followed the research questions listed in the “ UN PRPD guidance for conducting a situational country analysis of the rights of persons with disabilities. ” The analysis took place from March 2023 to June 2023. Due to the condensed timeframe of the analysis and the richness of existing literature, the analysis is primarily based on desk review of secondary literature and data, supplemented with key informant interviews, focus group discussions, an OPD preparatory workshop, and a multi-stakeholder consultation. \nFor desk research, the analysis draws comprehensively from existing literature on the preconditions of inclusion in China, ranging from the CRPD reviews, issue-based UN publications, government documents, official database and publications of the CDPF, articles published by OPDs, media reports, as well as Chinese and English language academic research. \nConsultations for the analysis focused on questions under-addressed by existing literature. Depending on stakeholders ’ accessibility preferences and availability, a mixture of consultation methods were adopted. The research team consulted in total 70 informants through in-person/online interviews, email questionnaires, focus group discussions, meetings, and soliciting written feedback and evidence. Email questionnaires and interviews were conducted with 33 OPDs, among which 42% of are unregistered grassroots groups, located in 18 different cities, working on promoting the rights of persons with physical, visual, intellectual, psychosocial, hearing, or multiple impairments, people with rare diseases, gender, and cross-disability issues. The team also interviewed and/or organized focus group discussions with 4 civil society organizations, and 5 government institutions, including the Education and Employment Department, Rights Protection Department, and Organizational and Liaison Department of the China Disabled Persons ’ Federation. Further, the research team reached out to 22 experts with domain-specific questions through written or online interviews, including scholars, lawyers, and UN agencies, among whom 6 are persons with disabilities. The draft report went through comprehensive reviews by 3 external experts, representing the perspectives of OPDs, policy makers, and development partners, with specializations in law, education, and OPD development. List of consulted stakeholders is not provided for protection of anonymity.",
            "Accessibility: China has issued more than 450 regulations, rules and normative documents on accessibility implementation and management. In recent years, campaigns are carried out to improve access to information. A further welcoming development is the new Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, passed on June 28, 2023. The effects of these policies depend on strong enforcement, sufficient remedies, and the meaningful engagement of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessibility tools and rules, with considerations of diverse needs among marginalized communities, such as deaf people/persons with hearing impairments, persons with intellectual disabilities, and persons with psychosocial disabilities. \nInclusive Service Delivery: Among 85 million officially estimated persons with disabilities, 38 million (44.7%) hold a disability certificate as of 2021. The task for service provision is daunting given the huge and diverse demands, and China has reached impressive coverage of services, especially in social p"

As shown in the draft Law on the Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, there is also a tendency to prioritize physical environment over access to information and service provision, especially for persons with intellectual or psychosocial impairments, and deaf people/persons with hearing impairments. \nAccountability and Governance: Disability has not yet been mainstreamed into the current governance structure. The CDPF system is assigned the responsibility for disability inclusion but with insufficient authority to coordinate with other ministries. This relatively segregated coordination mechanism within the government, according to stakeholders consulted, can form barriers for OPDs to engage mainstream ministries and obtain resources from the government which are concentrated within the DPF system. Consistent data collections on disability inclusion aligned with the CRPD and SDGs are lacking. Official statistics on disability adopt impairment-based definitions of disability and does not comply with the ICF or CRPD definitions of disability. Further, stakeholders are concerned about the reliability of self-reported data, the transparency of data, and the lack of disaggregated data by disability in mainstream data collections. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: Despite the much larger size compared to development partners, government budgeting prioritizes welfare provision over rights protection, and special rather than mainstream services. Significant power and resource imbalances exist between the duty bearers and rights holders. While development partners are reducing support for countries like China as its income level grows, development programs funded by foreign entities are under increasing legal and administrative scrutiny. This has impacted the development of independent OPDs which lack access to government resources.",
            "2023 marks the 15 th year since China has ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2008. The landscape of disability inclusion in China has been undergoing deep transformation. This Situational Analysis provides an overview of the five preconditions for disability inclusion, as defined by the United Nations Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNPRPD) — equality and non-discrimination, inclusive service delivery, accessibility, CRPD compliant budgeting, and accountability and governance; and three cross-cutting issues including participation, inequalities, and gender. For each area of inquiry, the analysis follows the research questions provided by the UNPRPD, in identifying the gaps and opportunities to inform future development programs. The analysis is primarily based on secondary literature review, supplemented with consultations, carried out between March 2023 and June 2023. \nEquality and Non-Discrimination: China has more than 80 laws and 50 administrative regulations directly related to the interests of persons with disabilities, and regularly updated its national strategy for disability since 1991. Translating these commitments into better inclusion requires efforts to better align disabilityrelated policies and laws with the social model of disability, meaningfully engage OPDs independent from the state in decision making, and fully implement accessibility, reasonable accommodations, and antidiscrimination provisions. Culturally, the charity or medical model of disability remains dominant in public attitudes. \nAccessibility: China has issued more than 450 regulations, rules and normative documents on accessibility implementation and management. In recent years, campaigns are carried out to improve access to information. A further welcoming development is the new Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, passed on June 28, 2023. The effects of these policies depend on strong enforcement, sufficient remedies, and the meaningful engagement of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessibility tools and rules, with considerations of diverse needs among marginalized communities, such as deaf people/persons with hearing impairments, persons with intellectual disabilities, and persons with psychosocial disabilities. \nInclusive Service Delivery: Among 85 million officially estimated persons with disabilities, 38 million (44.7%) hold a disability certificate as of 2021. The task for service provision is daunting given the huge and diverse demands, and China has reached impressive coverage of services, especially in social protection and rehabilitation. To better align with the CRPD, the next step is to shift the focus from welfare provision to social inclusion, from special needs to inclusive services. This would require better rights awareness, accessibility, and reasonable accommodations in mainstream services, such as health, education, and employment; stronger support for caregiving instead of demanding family responsibilities; and more equitable allocation of resources for marginalized communities, such as persons with disabilities in rural areas, persons with severe or multiple disabilities, women with disabilities, and persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: According to the Ministry of Finance, in 2021, the national public budget expenditure on disability affairs was CNY 70.6 billion, roughly 0.287% of the total national general public budget expenditure. Majority of the disability budget (43.3%) was spent on living and care subsidies. Inclusive services such as inclusive education and employment, as championed by the CRPD, need stronger financial support. \nAccountability and governance: The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recommends an independent mechanism appointed to monitor the implementation of the CRPD. The CDPF regularly collects data from disability certificate holders and publishes annual updates in its key mandates, yet the data is not specifically aligned with the definition of disability or priority areas of the CRPD or SDGs. Data disaggregated by disability in mainstream statistical efforts need enhancement.",
            "Rehabilitation \nRehabilitation services are stipulated by the Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities (2017). Rehabilitation services are mainly delivered through the health system, DPF system, and the civil affairs system. Children aged 0-6 are prioritized, and offered full coverage of rehabilitation services. 78 As of 2017, 65.6% of persons with disabilities had access to rehabilitation services. 79 In 2021, 47.8% of those receiving rehabilitation services are persons with physical disabilities, and another 18.5% are people with psychiatric disabilities. 80 In recent years, progress has been made to expand rehabilitation from centralized medical rehabilitation to community-based rehabilitation by OPDs and self-help groups. 81 OPDs consulted call for more rehabilitation services aimed at community inclusion such as in educational or vocational settings. \nAssistive Technologies \nPublic provision of assistive devices are delivered through CDPF ’s rehabilitation departments and the civil affairs system. In 2017, 2.4 million persons with disabilities received assistive devices, 82 including white canes, vision-assistive devices, wheelchairs, prosthetic limbs, hearing aids, and cochlear implants. Consultations show that gaps exist in obtaining affordable, accessible, usable, and customized assistive devices for persons with disabilities. Currently, most assistive devices are still delivered through the government ’s centralized planning, which resulted in the lack of customization, preference for products with lower bidding price over quality, and rigid restrictions for eligibility. 83 In recent years, cash subsidies for assistive technologies of the users ’ own choice are being piloted in places like Beijing, Liaoning, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. 84 Many user-friendly assistive technologies provided by private sector remain unaffordable for most persons with disabilities without subsides from the government. \nCare Services \nOfficially, care services for persons with disabilities include home-based care, day care, and residential care services, targeting people with intellectual, psychosocial disabilities, and people with severe physical disabilities. 85 National standards were set in 2019. 86 Some care facilities offer “ assistive employment ” programs for both rehabilitation and employment purposes through low skill labor such as handicraft making. As of 2021, 608988 disability certificate holders are residing in 11,278 institutionalized care services nationwide, including boarding institutions, day care, and more comprehensive facilities. 87 Consultation shows that the care responsibility mostly falls on family members, especially women, with little alternative options, but some policies continue to encourage a family-centered care approach. \nFor mental health care, data on the proportion of government budget spent on institutionalized care versus community-based support are not available. 88 Although specific plan and timeline to transition to community-based support (as per the CRPD) is unknown, China is promoting community-based rehabilitation for persons with psychosocial disabilities, setting the goal to cover at least 80% of counties across the country by 2025. 89",
            "part in voting and elections, joining representative bodies such as all levels of NPC and CPPCC, or working for state organs. There is no specific quota for persons with disabilities in the People ’s Congresses or Political Consultation Parties. In 2020, DPFs assisted 735 policy recommendations by people ’s congress and political consultation party delegates, and handled 1109 cases of their recommendations. 144 In practice, the lack of reasonable accommodations in political processes, the restrictions posed by mandatory public servant medical examinations, the tokenization of government employment quota, the preference for people with less severe disabilities, discriminatory social attitudes, and inadequate access to equal education, all contribute to the low rate of political participation of persons with disabilities. 145 Among persons with disabilities working at state institutions, persons with physical disabilities, and those with less severe disabilities are preferred. As of 2018, among local DPFs, 69.3% of municipal-level DPFs and 49.8% of county-level DPFs had staff members with disabilities. 146 As a step forward, in 2021, CDPF and four other ministries and departments issued a policy guidance regarding employing persons with disabilities in state organs, public institutions, and state-owned enterprises, explicitly requiring public sector employers to reasonably define the physical exam requirements for candidates with disabilities, and must not judge the candidates ’ health on the basis of their disability. 147 \n5. CRPD-compliant budgeting and financial management \nThere are three main mechanisms for the Chinese government to fund disability-related programs: regular public budget, special subsidy, and disability employment security fund (DESF). 148 From 2013 to 2017, the fiscal allocations from all levels of the government for persons with disabilities added up to over CNY 180 billion. 149 In 2021, the national public budget expenditure on disability affairs was CNY 70.6 billion, taking up 0.287% of the total national general public budget expenditure (24567.3 billion). 150 Compared to the scale of Chinese government budget (50-70 billion CNY per year), budgets of ongoing national development and humanitarian programs funded by international development partners are negligible. \nThe expenditures on disability affairs in 2021 included 30.6 billion on living and care subsidies (43.3%), 7.2 billion on rehabilitation, 6.6 billion on employment and poverty reduction, 5.5 billion on administrative costs, and 18.8 billion categorized as other expenditures. 151 In addition, CNY 16.1 billion of national public budget was spent on special education, 0.43% of the total education expenditures (3746.9 billion). 152 Article 48 of the 2017 Regulations on the Education of Persons with Disabilities stipulates that “ the financial funds allocated for compulsory education by local people ’s governments at all levels, as well as extra charges for education collected by these governments, shall have a certain proportion set aside for compulsory education for children and adolescents with disabilities. ” 153 Yet the proportion is not specified. \n146于娣.(2020).中国特色残联组织功能研究(博士学位论文,武汉理工大学). \nMost funding allocated for educating persons with disabilities are spent on special schools, and inclusive education in regular schools lacks financial support. 154 In 2021, The Action Plan for Special Education Development (2021-2025), issued in 2022 by the MOE, intends to increase the average government expenditure on compulsory education for children with disabilities from 6,000 yuan per student now to 7,000 yuan by 2025. 155",
            "to a much less extent, as consultations show. Most laws and regulations concerning disability pass without the formal input of non-state affiliated OPDs. An exception is the recent draft Law on Construction of BarrierFree Environments. The draft law was open for public comments in 2022 and 2023, and multiple OPDs organized public consultations and submitted comments. Results of their advocacy remain to be seen. Despite the lack of formal engagement, some independent OPDs have leveraged informal channels through key decision-makers, academics, NPC and CPPCC delegates to influence policy and law making. For instance, informants note that the inclusion of accessibility provisions in the Legal Aid Law was achieved through OPD collaboration with academic think tanks. \nConsultations show that formal mechanisms for participation tend to be highly selective, and exclusively accessed by CSOs, OPDs, or individuals with disabilities that are affiliated with or endorsed by the government, who take a rather service-oriented"

            "1.2 Disability Movement (OPDs) \nBased on the UNPRPD guidance, this report defines organizations of persons with disabilities (OPDs) as follows: “ Organizations of persons with disabilities are led, directed and governed by persons with disabilities. A clear majority of their membership should be recruited among persons with disabilities themselves. ” 20 According to this definition, organizations “ that work on disability inclusion are considered organizations ‘ for ’ persons with disabilities ” and do not count as OPDs. \nThe actual number of OPDs in China is unavailable and should be addressed by future research. Current estimations range from roughly 150 OPDs across China, 21 to only a handful of OPDs with continuous programs and staff, according to OPD informants consulted. Representative OPDs include, but are not limited to: 22 \nCross-disability OPDs: Cross-disability OPDs are among the most active at the national level. They pursue a diverse range of advocacy and service goals, including independent living, awareness raising of the CRPD, diverse employment (e.g. One Plus One Disability Group); public education on disability and gender equality (e.g. Beijing Enable Sister Center); inclusive education, and accessibility (e.g. Minority Voices). \nImpairment-based OPDs: In addition to cross-disability OPDs, many organizations serving communities of people with specific kinds of impairments are also active. These include organizations by and for people with physical impairments (e.g. Beijing New Start Foundation), deaf and/or people with hearing impairments (e.g. ProSigner, Know Deaf), people with visual impairments (e.g. Golden Cane 23 ), people with rare diseases (e.g. Illness Challenge Foundation), people with cerebral palsy (e.g. Angel House), and people on the autism spectrum (e.g. Mutual Support for Asperger's). \nOPDs in China tend to concentrate in urban areas, leaving a significant gap in smaller cities and rural areas. Many OPDs take the form of unregistered, online virtual groups, or small self-help groups, and very few have more than five full-time staff. Among existing OPDs, persons with intellectual disabilities, people with psychosocial disabilities, elderly people with disabilities, persons with disabilities living in rural areas, people with multiple impairments, and LGBTI persons with disabilities are underrepresented. For persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities, self-advocacy groups are still rare. Most of their representative groups are led by parents.",
            "Participation: OPDs independent from the government lack the opportunity to participate meaningfully in policy and decision making. Formal mechanisms for OPD participation prefer state-affiliated, serviceoriented organizations/individuals. Many independent OPDs operate as unregistered, self-help groups run by volunteers, in the absence of sufficient financial and human resources for professionalization. Compared to other CSOs, leaders with disabilities have lower social capital due to systemic exclusion in education, community participation, and other critical life opportunities. While grassroots OPDs are often blamed for lacking the capacity to engage in policy making and development programs, mechanisms for engagement fail to consider these preexisting disadvantages and provide support systems to prioritize the voices of persons with disabilities, especially the most marginalized. Even at occasions for dialogues with policy makers, grassroots OPDs and leaders with disabilities experience significant power imbalances in the authority to speak about disability and access to resources, compared to experts, professionals, and decision-makers without disabilities. They see such engagement as “ unbalanced, insufficient, and unequal. ” \nInequalities and Gender: Persons with disabilities in rural areas, who constitute the majority of the disabled population in China, are still largely unreached by development programs. They face harsher living conditions, and more likelihood to acquire severe disabilities, but less access to healthcare, education, employment, and accessible environment. Due to the financial structure of local DPFs, which obtain funding from same-level government instead of the CDPF, areas that are less economically developed tend to have lower budget on disability, despite higher needs. Among these groups, women with disabilities and people with multiple disabilities are further disadvantaged. Yet existing government and development programs tend to consider gender and disability in isolation, resulting in the lack of gender awareness in disability inclusion programs and policies, and vice versa. \nOpportunities \nHaving completed the poverty alleviation campaign in 2020, the government ’s ongoing priority is rural revitalization and achieving common prosperity, namely, reducing inequalities and income gaps between urban and rural areas. Persons with disabilities significantly overlap with China ’s most impoverished population. Increasing high-quality jobs is a key approach for economic empowerment, especially during China ’s post-COVID economic recovery. In 2022, the State Council adopted the Three-Year Action Plan on Promoting Disability Employment (2022-2024), setting the target of generating one million new jobs for persons with disabilities over three years, and encouraging the public sector to take the lead in hiring persons with disabilities. Changes in the private sector are also happening, such as the global push for more stakeholder-centric approach to doing business, including the Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) framework. More corporations begin to adopt disability inclusion in their ESG framework, providing an entry-point for disability-inclusive employment. As such, stakeholders of disability inclusion see opportunities in promoting decent work in government, big corporations, and rural areas. This can also pave the way for more meaningful participation in policy and decision making, as more persons with disabilities enter the public and private sector as employees.",
            "7. To establish meaningful mechanisms to enhance OPD participation and amplify the voices of persons with disabilities in UN supported programmes. For instance, within the UNPRPD program, pilot test a mechanism for OPDs to partner with scholars/CSOs/think tanks/associations on evidence-based policy advocacy. The latter stakeholders can function as intermediaries between grassroots OPDs and policy makers. The collaboration mechanism should combine OPDs ’ disability-specific expertise, with the allies ’ domain-specific expertise and government access (e.g. education, health/SRHR, employment, or accessibility), and produce joint products for policy advocacy (e.g. reports, policy proposals, internal briefings, or pilot programs). The mechanism should fully leverage OPDs ’ leadership and expertise in analyzing community needs, while strengthening OPDs ’ policy advocacy skills and local-level support networks. It should also serve to increase the disability inclusion awareness and capabilities of domain experts. OPDs shall play a leading role in the mechanism, with sufficient decision-making power at each stage of the project, rather than mere data collectors. The UN should aim for creating opportunities for de-bureaucratized, informal engagement among stakeholders. \n8. To strengthen the resources and capacity for grassroots OPDs to participate in policy making, implementation, and monitoring in UN funded programmes. This could serve as models of good practice for other local programmes. Leverage the UNPRPD program and platforms such as the UNTGD, to facilitate regular knowledge exchanges among OPDs and stakeholders on successful engagement with existing participation mechanisms. These can include best practices of partnering with governmenttrusted think tanks for policy advocacy, submitting proposals to the NPC and CPPCC sessions, engagement strategies with government entities, campaigns for mobilizing public comments on draft legislations, monitoring the implementation of accessibility standards, participation in UN human rights treaty mechanisms, and effective collaboration with the private sector. The UN should provide a safe space and allocate sufficient resources to ensure OPDs and individuals with disabilities with less access can benefit. \n9. To create platforms for capacity building and international exchange for grassroots OPDs. Although development funding is negligible compared to the scale of government budget on disability, resources for OPDs remain scarce. OPDs operating in similar social and economic contexts can share ideas and build peer-support networks. It can also increase the visibility of Chinese OPDs at the international level and share Chinese best practices with other countries. \n10. To prioritize women with disabilities and marginalized communities in the design of the PRPD program. Prioritize the leadership of women with disabilities in development programs, and support gender-sensitive approaches to disability programs, rather than merely including female participants in activities. Allocate sufficient financial and human resources to support the meaningful participation of marginalized communities, such as travel, lodging, personal assistance, and reasonable accommodations. \n11. To enhance disability and gender mutual mainstreaming within the UN system. The 2022 Disability Inclusion Scorecard Assessment shows that the UNCT still fall short in meeting Indicator 8 “ Joint programmes: Joint programmes contribute to disability inclusion ” and Indicator 9 “ Data: Strengthening data on persons with disabilities. ” OPDs expect the UN to further implement the United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy, and model best practices such as incorporating disability components, indicators, and OPDs in non-disability focused UN programs, employing persons with disabilities, enhancing the accessibility of UN offices and meetings, and increasing the collection and disclosure of data disaggregated by types of disability, degrees of disability, and location of persons with disabilities. \nwww.UNPRPD.org",

By 2020, establish a modern insurance industry that is comprehensive, stable, well-functioning and credible. \n• SDG 10.3: Establish a more equitable and sustainable social protection system that better protect rights and interests of vulnerable social groups such as women, minors, and people with disabilities. \nIn China ’s Progress Report on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2021), persons with disabilities were reported as beneficiaries of China ’s progress on SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG4 (quality education), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). 190 In China ’s 2021 Voluntary National Review, people with disabilities are mentioned as beneficiaries of China ’s efforts in SDG 1.5, the world ’s largest social security system, and COVID response. No specific evidence was provided regarding the implementation of the disability-related goals listed in China ’s Action Plan. 191 There is no reference to OPD participation or capacity development support of OPDs in the Action Plan, Progress Report, or Voluntary National Review. \nThe UNSDCF (2021-2025) with China included disability-related support in “ Outcome 2: People ’s lives in China are improved further as headway is made in ensuring access to childcare, education, healthcare services, elderly care, housing, and social assistance, and more people in China, including left-behind groups, benefit from equitable and high-quality public services and social protection systems as well as accelerated efforts to reduce gender inequality and other forms of social inequality throughout the lifecourse. ” 192 The UNTGD is fully consulted in the country plans and strategies, processes and reporting. Other bilateral agencies and donors promote and engage in disability rights through their participation in the UNTGD meetings and activities, but most from disability-specific rather than disability mainstreaming perspectives.",
            "Analysis of key gaps and opportunities \nGaps \nEquality and non-discrimination: Attitudinal barriers are considered by stakeholders as one of the most fundamental challenges that cuts across all preconditions for inclusion. Progress has been made since the adoption of CRPD in 2008 in terms of awareness-raising of the social model of disability, especially among development partners and OPDs/CSOs. Yet the Chinese society at large and its corresponding systems are predominantly taking a medical model approach to disability, regarding persons with disabilities as subjects of charity and welfare in need of special rather than mainstream services. Policy makers and service providers, especially at grassroots levels, lack the awareness and buy-in of CRPD or the social model of disability. Laws and regulations relevant to disability are not fully aligned with the CRPD, and lack strength in enforcement and remedies. \nInclusive Service Delivery: The current policy frameworks tend to regard persons with disabilities as welfare beneficiaries more than rights holders. Public provision of disability support services prioritize social protection, subsidies, and rehabilitation, less focused on building support systems for the equal participation of persons with disabilities in society, such as inclusive education and employment. Policy makers are incentivized to maximize service coverage for the large population of persons with disabilities with limited resources, de-emphasizing the quality of services. The agency and autonomy of persons with disabilities is downplayed. As reflected in multi-stakeholder consultations, OPDs are concerned about the policy focus on family ’s responsibility in caregiving for persons with disabilities, without sufficient government support. \nAccessibility: Unchecked discrimination against persons with disabilities, combined with the lack of reasonable accommodations and accessibility, pose consistent barriers in all aspects of social participation of persons with disabilities. Despite increased government investment in accessibility, weak enforcement, insufficient remedies, and the lack of meaningful participation of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessible tools and standards has resulted in the poor quality of accessibility measures.

            "The situation and rights of persons with disabilities is incorporated into the Common Country Analysis, UNSDCF and Joint Work Plans in full consultation with the UNTGD. As a result, the UNSDCF 2021-2025 has integrated disability inclusion by setting the commitment to “ leaving no one behind ” as one of its guiding principles and explicitly identifying persons with disabilities as one o f the groups more at risk of being left behind in China. Persons with disability are particularly referenced in parts related to rehabilitation services, full social inclusion, development, and legitimate rights and interests. Besides, UNSDCF also specifically stipulates that the participation of CDPF in the review and implementation of the UNSDCF will be made at the level of the Results Groups. \nSpecifically, under the UNSDCF Strategic Priority 1 “ People and Prosperity: Achieving innovation-driven, coordinated and shared development ”, Outcome 2 reads, “ People ’s lives in China are improved further as headways is made in ensuring access to childcare, education, healthcare services, elderly care, housing, and social assistance, and more people in China, including left-behind groups, benefit from equitable and high quality public services and social protection systems as well as accelerated efforts to reduced gender inequality and other forms of social inequality throughout the life-course. ” \nThe UN makes an effort to engage persons with disabilities and their representative organizations closely across ongoing programs at country level. One attempt was to make the UN premises more accessible. An assessment on the accessibility of the physical environment and services of all UN premises in China has been completed with support of the Accessibility Development Institute of Tsinghua University in 2021, with detailed recommendations provided for improvement. \nUNTGD provides a platform for international development partners to engage with OPDs. Currently, a few bilateral and multilateral donors such as the European Commission and British Council still have programs on disability. However, consultations show that international cooperation is increasingly scrutinized by authorities, and OPDs and local stakeholders are cautious about such engagement. \n1.6 Other Key Stakeholders (Academic, Private sector): Academic institutions or think tanks play an important role in the sector, due to their access to policy making channels. However, not all academics are aligned with the CRPD. OPDs are concerned that some academic institutions regard disability as an object of research but do not meaningfully engage OPDs, displacing rather than amplifying the voices of persons with disabilities. \nPrivate sector is increasingly active in disability inclusion, due to shifting funding structure for OPDs/CSOs, domestic policy incentives for disability-inclusive employment and services, and global corporate cultural change towards Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), and corporate social responsibility (CSR). A few social enterprises have been active in engaging the private sector. However, balancing the interests of business clients and the disability community is a challenge, which needs to involve different stakeholders, including government, disability advocates, and businesses themselves. A missed opportunity identified by informants is the lack of engagement with OPDs, reinforcing the fragmentation of limited resources of the field. Further, most businesses still lack the awareness of the social model of disability, taking a charity-based or tokenistic approach.",
            "1.5 International Cooperation (UN Agencies, Donors) \nUNPRPD China Programme was implemented from 2014 to 2020. As a result of the Programme, the UN Country Team in China formed and institutionalized the UN Theme Group on Disability (UNTGD), a comprehensive, multi-stakeholder platform composing of over 100 key stakeholders for open dialogue and advocacy on the needs and rights of persons with disabilities in China. The UNTGD aims to consolidate the efforts and foster consultation and collaboration of its members including UN agencies and external disability stakeholders, in supporting the government in fulfilling its commitments to the CRPD and in achieving national goals on ensuring the equal rights of persons with disabilities. \nThe UNTGD is positioned to support the effective implementation of UN ’s collective commitments and actions in the new UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF), and to strengthen the UN ’s accountability towards disability inclusion in response to the Disability Inclusion Scorecard. The UNRCO and all UN agencies have respectively assigned a disability focal point as UNTGD member. The following agencies are especially engaging in advancing the rights of persons with disabilities with specific focuses relevant to their respective mandates: \n• UNESCO: inclusive education, information accessibility, promotion of disability inclusion through and in media and culture, media and information as well as digital literacy \n• UNICEF: inclusive education, accessible and child-friendly environment, social protection for children with disabilities, inclusive child welfare and protection services, public awareness raising and advocacy on disability inclusion. \n• UNFPA: strengthen universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) and GBV information and services, and advocate disability data generation \n• UNDP: access to justice for persons with disabilities \n• ILO: employment and decent work for persons with disabilities \n• UN Women: Research on gender gaps between men with disabilities and women with disabilities and support the advocacy of the rights of women and girls with disabilities \nNo other UN agencies ’ joint programs supporting legislative reforms, policy development or other relevant national programs that are important for persons with disabilities are available. \nThe knowledge and understanding of UN agencies staff on disability inclusive programming have been gradually enhanced in recent years, especially among the staff members from the agencies that are closely involved in the capacity building activities and joint programmes and activities on disability inclusion. Key trainings include: a half-day meeting and discussion on disability equality for UN staff held on 1 August 2018, participated by 18 UN colleagues from 10 UN agencies; a Disability Equality Training workshop for UNCT held in 2019 to strengthen the UNCT ’s capacity to ensure a human rights-based approach to disability is reflected in their work at all times, participated by 16 representatives from six UN agencies; a knowledge sharing session at the regular meeting of the UN Communications Group in China on media communications for promoting disability equality in China held in 2021, participated by communication officers from 20 UN agencies; and the six-day Induction workshop held under the UNPRPD 4th Funding Call Inception Phase in November-December 2022, participated by six colleagues representing 5 UN agencies, including UNESCO, ILO, UNFPA, WHO, UN Women and FAO.",
            "China ’s ageing population has made the provision of accessible environment and services ever more urgent. COVID-19 also heightened the issue of digital divide in China, making it pressing for improving the digital accessibility and digital literacy among persons with disabilities and elderly people. The new Law on the Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, passed on June 28, 2023, is indicative of the growing importance of accessibility in recent years, and creates a policy window for more awareness-raising on accessibility, including built environment, information and communication, and services. Although the second draft of the law is still criticized for having “ no teeth ” or remedies, its symbolic presence can boost the legitimacy of local OPDs ’ existing efforts in requesting access with public service providers (e.g. subway, banks, etc.). Government stakeholders also foresee needs for technical and publicity support on promoting the new legislation and specifying local-level enforcement measures. In addition, policies like the 2021 Special Action Plan on Elderly-oriented and Barrier-free Modifications for Internet Applications, the 2021 Action Plan on Improving National Digital Literacy and Skills, and China ’s entry into the Marrakesh Treaty, create incentives for more stakeholders to engage in accessibility. To take advantage of these developments, OPDs call for attention to the digital literacy divide caused by lack of access to digital tools or skills. \nChina ’s population policies have been undergoing transformations in recent years. Since 2021, couples in China are allowed to have three children with support measures. 206 In 2022, China witnessed its first population decline in 60 years. 207 While family planning policies continue to relax and policy incentives for child-rearing increase, the implications for persons with disabilities are unclear. On one hand, persons with disabilities lack equal access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) care; on the other hand, preventing disability remains a health target in national health strategies. 208 To maximize the benefits and minimize the harm of the increased investment in population growth and health management, the SRH needs of persons with disabilities warrant attention. Meanwhile, SRH offers an entry-point for persons with disabilities to address cross-cutting issues such as gender-based violence, education and health inequity, and the agency and autonomy of individuals with disabilities. \nA potential mechanism to expand OPD participation in decision-making is to take part in research that can serve as evidence for policy making. This is in line with the Communist Party ’s recent promotion for research and survey among Party members to better connect policy and practice. 209 Best practices include OPDs organizing community focus groups and partnering with scholars involved in policy making to submit proposals or policy opinions; combining short-term trainings with long-term regular research groups; and co-authoring independent surveys/study reports with subject matter experts. \nA gradual cultural shift is taking place from the medical model to the social model. More self-advocates with disabilities and new narratives are emerging in mainstream and social media, challenging stereotypes about disability. These circumstances present a crucial opportunity for the UN to leverage its influence, such as advocating for policy changes that align with the CRPD, building capacity and providing platforms for OPDs and individual advocates, and support the government, including CDPF and other ministries, in promoting inclusive services.",

            "China ’s ageing population has made the provision of accessible environment and services ever more urgent. COVID-19 also heightened the issue of digital divide in China, making it pressing for improving the digital accessibility and digital literacy among persons with disabilities and elderly people. The new Law on the Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, passed on June 28, 2023, is indicative of the growing importance of accessibility in recent years, and creates a policy window for more awareness-raising on accessibility, including built environment, information and communication, and services. Although the second draft of the law is still criticized for having “ no teeth ” or remedies, its symbolic presence can boost the legitimacy of local OPDs ’ existing efforts in requesting access with public service providers (e.g. subway, banks, etc.). Government stakeholders also foresee needs for technical and publicity support on promoting the new legislation and specifying local-level enforcement measures. In addition, policies like the 2021 Special Action Plan on Elderly-oriented and Barrier-free Modifications for Internet Applications, the 2021 Action Plan on Improving National Digital Literacy and Skills, and China ’s entry into the Marrakesh Treaty, create incentives for more stakeholders to engage in accessibility. To take advantage of these developments, OPDs call for attention to the digital literacy divide caused by lack of access to digital tools or skills. \nChina ’s population policies have been undergoing transformations in recent years. Since 2021, couples in China are allowed to have three children with support measures. 206 In 2022, China witnessed its first population decline in 60 years. 207 While family planning policies continue to relax and policy incentives for child-rearing increase, the implications for persons with disabilities are unclear. On one hand, persons with disabilities lack equal access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) care; on the other hand, preventing disability remains a health target in national health strategies. 208 To maximize the benefits and minimize the harm of the increased investment in population growth and health management, the SRH needs of persons with disabilities warrant attention. Meanwhile, SRH offers an entry-point for persons with disabilities to address cross-cutting issues such as gender-based violence, education and health inequity, and the agency and autonomy of individuals with disabilities. \nA potential mechanism to expand OPD participation in decision-making is to take part in research that can serve as evidence for policy making. This is in line with the Communist Party ’s recent promotion for research and survey among Party members to better connect policy and practice. 209 Best practices include OPDs organizing community focus groups and partnering with scholars involved in policy making to submit proposals or policy opinions; combining short-term trainings with long-term regular research groups; and co-authoring independent surveys/study reports with subject matter experts. \nA gradual cultural shift is taking place from the medical model to the social model. More self-advocates with disabilities and new narratives are emerging in mainstream and social media, challenging stereotypes about disability. These circumstances present a crucial opportunity for the UN to leverage its influence, such as advocating for policy changes that align with the CRPD, building capacity and providing platforms for OPDs and individual advocates, and support the government, including CDPF and other ministries, in promoting inclusive services.",

            "4.3 Mainstream Services \nSocial protection \nChina ’s social protection system for persons with disabilities include three main mechanisms: 1) welfare subsidies (fuli butie), such as living subsidies for disabled persons in hardships, and care subsidies for persons with severe disabilities; 2) social insurance subsidies (shehui baoxian butie), such as pension and medical insurance subsidies; and 3) special assistance (zhuanxiang jiuzhu), such as minimum living standard guarantee (dibao), and assistance for disaster, healthcare, education, and housing. 90 \nChina has reached wide coverage of social protection for persons with disabilities. For example, living allowances for poor people with disabilities and nursing subsidies for severely disabled persons now cover more than 24 million people. 10.67 million people with disabilities are included in the system of subsistence allowances. All poor persons with disabilities are covered by basic medical insurance and serious illness insurance, according to an official white paper. 91 \nBy 2021, China has declared success in lifting more than 7 million persons with disabilities out of absolute poverty. 92 Yet persons with disabilities remain economically marginalized. Experts estimate that 36% to 44% of certified persons with disabilities in China can be considered under “ relative poverty. ” 93 In 2019, over 30% of total disability certificate holders received living subsidies for disabled persons in hardships, and care subsidies for persons with severe disabilities. 94 Social protection remains an important source of income for persons with disabilities, making up 13.2% of total disabled persons ’ household income on average. 95 Households with the lowest income are most dependent on social protection, but their average income from social protection was merely CNY 2,631.30 per year, as of 2019. 96",
            "7.2 Inclusion of marginalised groups \nPeople with disabilities with low income \nThe correlation between poverty and disability is globally known, and China is no exception. Officially, over 7 million persons with disabilities have been lifted out of absolute poverty by 2021. 172 Yet persons with disabilities remain economically marginalized. Depending on the evaluation criteria, experts estimate that 36% to 44% of certified persons with disabilities in China can be considered under “ relative poverty. ” 173 As a CDPF official points out, households of persons with disabilities persistently earn less than 60% of the national average, and the gap continues to widen (see Figure 2). 174 \nHouseholds of persons with disabilities typically have “ high costs, low income. ” In 2018, healthcare expenses of families of persons with disabilities make up 26.3% of total household expenditures, 1.6 times that of the national average. The Engel's Coefficient (food expenditure to overall expenditure ratio) of persons with disabilities was as high as 40.9% in 2018, significantly higher than the national average (28.4%). 176 The least well-off among people with disabilities live in rural areas. In 2018, urban households of persons with disabilities earned 1.7 times more than rural households. Among the rural population with disabilities, over half have severe disabilities (holders of Level 1 or Level 2 certificates). 177 This indicates a greater gap in meeting their needs for care, accessibility, rehabilitation, assistive devices, basic public services, and work, exacerbating their poverty. \nPeople with intellectual and/or psychosocial disabilities People with intellectual disabilities fare the worst economically among all persons with disabilities. In 2018, the average personal annual income for people with intellectual disabilities was CNY 11,388.3, roughly 70% of the income of people with physical disabilities, the highest income group. Their average salary income was a mere CNY 1,600.4 per year, lowest among all persons with disabilities, indicating their lack of access to formal employment opportunities. 178 In consultation, parents are the primary caregivers of persons with intellectual disabilities. They lack support from the government and alternative options for caregiving, and are concerned about the absence of affordable, high-quality care as they reach older age or pass away. \nFor people with psychosocial disabilities, an early analysis based on the 2006 disability sample survey data found that “ psychiatric disability, ” as defined by Chinese law, was significantly correlated with poverty. 179 Expert informants are concerned that institutional paternalism and stigma has led to substituted decisionmaking instead of supported decision making that respects the person ’s autonomy, lack of recognition of legal capacity, and restricted social participation of persons with psychosocial disabilities. Although China ’s Mental Health Law stipulates the right to litigation and the principle of voluntary diagnosis and hospitalization, in judicial practices, persons with psychosocial disabilities still lack decision-making power and court decisions continue to emphasize the role of legal guardians and family members. 180 The scarcity of high-quality community-based services is also a reality.",
            "7.3 Gender equality \nWomen with disabilities face disproportionate, multiple discrimination caused by the intersection of gender, disability, and class. 184 An early study (2001-2010) funded by the State Council Committee on Women and Children ’s Work and CDPF shows that in 2010, 55.3% of women with disabilities never received any education, 27.9 percentage points higher than men with disabilities. A mere 26.4% of women with disabilities were employed, 12.4 percentage points lower than men with disabilities. In 2010, the average annual income of women with disabilities was CNY 3,501, making up only 44.1% of total women ’s income, and 85.9% of the income of men with disabilities. The situation is worse in rural areas. Among rural women with disabilities, only 4.3% of received education above high school level, and 33.7% were illiterate. For rural women with disabilities, their average annual income was CNY 1,173, less than one third of urban women with disabilities, and roughly half of them were entirely financially dependent on family members. Rural women with disabilities also reported higher incidents of domestic violence (20.7%) than women with disabilities in general (19.1%). 185 A 2015 baseline study jointly conducted by Sichuan University, a local DPF, and a women ’s federation, found that among the 113 government officials (city, district, county, and village level) they surveyed, most did not think women with disabilities face more discrimination, and 88.5% believed that gender-specific services were not necessary. Only 3-5% of officials had exposure to SOGI related trainings, and 35.4% received trainings on disability rights protection. 186",
            "A decade later, women with disabilities face continued barriers in care, marriage and social life, reproductive health care, and equal opportunities to employment, as shown in a women ’s OPD survey of 535 women with disabilities. 187 Another recent multi-year OPD survey of 1,083 women with disabilities reveals that as high as 33% of them were once told to discontinue their education. Among educated informants, 24% experienced dropout because of their disability. 54.3% of women studied were not employed, for whom caretaking responsibilities and unsuccessful job seeking are the main reasons. Over half of the women reported experiences of rejection for job opportunities because of their disability, and 34.4% because of their gender. Most working women, on the other hand, received no support on workplace accessibility and reasonable accommodation, and 44.7% of them did not receive equal pay for equal work. Over half of the informants reported personal income as lower than CNY 2000 per month. 36.3% of women surveyed in 2020 experienced loss of income due to COVID-19. 188 \nIn 2020, the CDPF, supported by UN ESCAP, UN Women, UNFPA, and Rehabilitation International, released a “ Call to Action: Enabling Sisters with Disabilities to Join in Shaping the Future We Want ” in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action at the Fourth World Conference on Women, and the fifth year of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Promoting adequate standard of living, health, and education of women and girls with disabilities are among the top of the list of call for actions. Sexual and reproductive health is considered a key entry point of intervention for women and LGBTI persons with disabilities by consulted stakeholders, which, in the context of China, connects cross-cutting issues of healthcare, education, employment, accessibility, anti-violence, and rights awareness raising for persons with disabilities. \n8. Disability Inclusion in Broader Development, Humanitarian & Emergency Contexts \n8.1 National Development Plans \nIn China ’s National Plan on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 189 disability was explicitly mentioned in China ’s action plan for goal 4 (quality education), 8 (decent work and economic growth), and 10 (reduced inequalities). Specifically, China ’s actions plans with explicit reference to disability include: \n• SDG 4.2: Improve the funding system for preschool education to help the less-privileged, such as children from needy families, orphans and children with disabilities, to gain access to public preschool education. Improve the quality of kindergarten teachers \n• SDG 4.5: Protect everyone ’s right including that of vulnerable groups to education, and improve special education. Open special education schools in counties with more than 300,000 residents and gradually ensure 12-year free education for children with disabilities, covering the 9-year compulsory education and the senior high school education. \n• SDG 8.5: Increase labor force participation rate through implementation of the classification policy. Vigorously enforce the Law on Promotion of Employment. Targeted measures have been formulated to promote employment of university graduates, migrant workers, people with disabilities, retired soldiers, women and some other groups. Improve employment and entrepreneurship services and launch a lifelong vocational training initiative.",

            "全生命周期视角\n心智障碍者任何一个生命阶段之间都是连续的、有相续影响的。 \n因此，对心智障碍者的支持应该从全生命周期着眼，根据需求提供持续支持。例如：心智障碍者需要接受终身教育，他们在每一个生命阶段都有成长和发展的需求和潜力，都有可以学习的主题。 \n系统支持视角\n1.来自生态系统的横向支持\n任何人都不能完全孤立生活，每个人身边都有着或近或远的各种系统，并需要借助这些系统的支持，获得成长和发展的资源。 \n例如：父母、手足、爱人、亲戚属于家庭系统；邻居、社区超市、理发馆、小餐馆都属于社区系统；老师、同学属于学校系统；领导、同事属于工作系统；康复师、社工、服务机构的工作人员属于专业系统；路上的陌生人、公交车上遇到的乘客、警察、医生等等都属于社会系统；有关残障人士、儿童保护等法律法规属于政策系统… … \n2.来自全生命周期的纵向支持\n心智障碍者在不同的人生阶段（或者说不同年龄阶段） ，可以得到符合当下需求的不同支持。 （请参考下文“心智障碍者全生命周期概览” ） \n3.要支持，不要矫治\n•心智障碍者不是“不正常” ，只是“不一样” ，他们不需要被矫正成所谓的“正常人” 。 \n•面对心智障碍者，我们需要做的是，首先接纳和尊重他们，不以此为耻，将他们当作“人” ，而不是“问题”来看待。 \n•然后试着了解他们的需求，在他们无法做到的事情上，要站在他们的角度，给予适合、适度的支持，使他们可以带着“心智障碍”过常态化的生活。 \n4.改变环境，不是改变人（心智障碍者） \n•心智障碍者在与外界环境或人建立联系时，外界所造成的障碍其实大过于他们本身。",
            "尽管世界各国经济发展水平和历史传统各不相同，许多国家探索出了多种多样的“社区自主生活”的实践模式。社区自主生活的实现应以最小隔离、最小限制、最大程度地支持心智障碍者融入和参与社区生活为目标。 \n原则二：最小限制\n心智障碍者面临的限制往往来自于与他/她互动的人（同伴、老师、家长）和基于限制目的的制度和习惯做法。例如，在家庭生活中，家长出于营养配餐角度，要求心智障碍者每天按照既定菜谱进食。这样的用餐安排，对于心智障碍者而言就是巨大的限制因素。最小限制就是尽量减少甚至消除未经共识的限制因素，支持心智障碍者拥有可自我掌控的生活方式。 \n原则三：适宜支持\n适宜的支持是指支持者（家长、同伴、老师、个人助理等）通过细致的观察和有效沟通，在排除偏见、放下控制欲之后，根据心智障碍者的意愿、偏好和需要提供的有效支持。支持需以“必要且最少为原则” ，把握好支持的形态和强度，避免过多或过度，尽可能为心智障碍者创设自主选择和练习的机会。最适合的支持以最小隔离和最小限制为前提条件，只有在最小隔离和最小限制的环境中才有可能实现最适合的支持。 \n心智障碍者与所有人一样，都有权利选择自己想过的生活，可以自由地为自己的生活作出决定、选择和安排，而不是由别人替他/她们做决定、进行选择和安排。",
            "•自主生活不意味着让心智障碍者只做单纯享乐的被照顾对象。心智障碍者在自由选择和掌控生活的同时，要去学习承担责任和付出努力。心智障碍者在实践自主生活的过程中必然要承担挫折和挑战，这是成长的必经之痛，经历过磨砺和蜕变之后最终收获个人生活的幸福感，拥有和谐的家庭、社群和社会关系。这是每一个人必须走上的生活道路，不论残障与否，无论贫穷或者富有。 \n•自主生活不是只能在专业化的服务中才能实现。有些优秀的个人助理服务能够为心智障碍者和支持者示范一种自主生活模式，高素质的专业支持者能够更好地看到心智障碍者自身的优势和潜能，较少受到偏见和掌控欲的限制。然而，在专业服务之外，心智障碍者依然可以在其他自然支持者（如家人、同伴、志愿者、其他社区居民等）的支持下实现自主生活，关键在于支持者是否相信自主是可能的且有价值的。",
            "体价格偏高，造成了严重的供需失衡。 \n3.对家庭照护者的支持\n【家长喘息服务】 \n除政策支持和普惠性公共服务外，为家庭照护者提供喘息服务是较为常见的社会组织服务形式之一，即向家庭照护者提供一个可以休息、喘息的时间和机会。例如美国的社区会为特殊儿童家长提供社区喘息服务，主要有居家喘息照护和居外喘息照看。国内服务于心智障碍领域的社会组织也提供类似的居家喘息照护服务，如壹基金的家长加油站项目、晓更基金会的趾印计划项目等。也有少数家长团体以非正式的互助形式解决心智障碍者家庭的临时喘息需求，如AB两家一直保持着良好关系， A家父母生病或有事外出，由B家临时代为照顾A家的心智障碍子女。 \n【家庭支持技能提升】 \n家庭支持是多方面的，家人观念"

The nominating committee shall in accordance with democratic procedures nominate a certain number of candidates for the office of the Chief Executive, who is to be elected through universal suffrage by all registered electors of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and to be appointed by the Central People’s Government.\nIt is held at the Meeting that with the joint efforts of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the people of Hong Kong, the democratic system of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will definitely make progress continuously, and that the aim of the selection of the Chief Executive and the election of all the members of the Legislative Council by universal suffrage will be realized in accordance with the Hong Kong Basic Law and this Decision.",
            "The participants hold that since the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Hong Kong residents have enjoyed democratic rights that they had never had before. The first Chief Executive was elected by the Selection Committee, which was composed of 400 members. The second Chief Executive was elected by the Election Committee, which was composed of 800 members. Out of the 60 members of the Legislative Council, the number of members returned by geographical constituencies through direct elections has increased from 20 in the Legislative Council in the first term to 24 in the Legislative Council in the second term and will reach 30 in the Legislative Council in the third term to be formed in September this year. Hong Kong does not have a long history of practising democratic elections, and it is not seven years yet since Hong Kong residents exercised the democratic right to participate in the selection of the Chief Executive of the Special Administrative Region. Since the return of Hong Kong to the motherland, the number of members of the Legislative Council returned by geographical constituencies through direct elections has increased by a fairly wide margin. When the setup is such that half of the members are returned by geographical constituencies through direct elections and the other half by functional constituencies, the impact on the operation of the Hong Kong society as a whole, especially the impact on the executive-led system, remains to be tested through practice. Moreover, at present, different sectors of the Hong Kong society have considerable differences on how to determine the methods for selecting the Chief Executive and for forming the Legislative Council after the year 2007 and have not come to a broad consensus.

            "培养兴趣、学会休闲\n培养兴趣不仅为了陶冶情操、发展特长，这也是心智障碍者打发休闲时光的积极方式，所以需要为心智障碍者提供尽可能多的机会，去尝试不同的休闲方式，发掘他们的兴趣，如：各种体育运动、演奏乐器、绘画、手工制作/拼装、阅读（字或图画）等等。尤其对于障碍程度较重的心智障碍者，学会自己打发休闲时光非常重要，让他们的生活能够充实、有想做的事，并从中获得满足感和对生活的掌控感。 \n拥有同龄人普遍的常态生活\n心智障碍者需要有机会使用典型青少年的用品，如：手机、网络的运用。与其他普通青少年有相似的经验，有利于促进他们与同龄人的交往，有更多共同语言。当然，照顾者也需要和他们达成共识或建立行为规则，适度使用手机/网络，避免过度沉迷，影响视力和生活规律。 \n保持运动习惯\n心智障碍者需要尽可能养成和保持终身运动的习惯，适当的运动可以帮助他们用恰当的方式释放多余精力、缓解情绪、降低健康风险。 \n随着心智障碍者进入学校，他们的生活半径也会产生变化。为了帮助心智障碍者适应新的环境，照护者既要有效借助旧的生活圈帮助他们调剂减压，也要逐步开发新的资源来建设校外支持圈，例如： \n熟悉的亲友圈\n以前经常团聚的亲友小圈子，周末等时间还是可以继续聚一聚，让心智障碍者有机会处在熟悉的人和活动中，这样他们感受到的变化就不是全然一新的，对照护者而言也算是一种暂时的喘息。 \n与从前的老师、康复师保持联系",
