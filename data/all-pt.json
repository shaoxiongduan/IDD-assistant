Continued efforts should be made to improve the publicity of and education in the legal system among juveniles, in order to help them understand from childhood the basic code of conduct which should be abided by and cultivate the behavioral habit of learning and observing laws. Managers and administrators of enterprises should concentrate their efforts on cultivating their sense of the need to be honest and to observe laws and their awareness of their social responsibilities, in order to improve their ability in managing and administering affairs in accordance with law. It is necessary to bring into full play the publicity of and education in the legal system in the drive for building a new socialist countryside, to give the farmers guidance in participating in self-government and administration of social affairs in accordance with law, and in learning and mastering the legal means and knowledge about how to safeguard their lawful rights and interests, solve problems and settle disputes.\n(3) Adhering to the principle of combining the publicity of and education in the legal system with the practice of rule by law, in order to raise the level of administration according to law in the whole society. It is necessary to analyze experience and to have the local authorities and different trades administer their affairs according to law in an all-around way, in order to further raise their level of law-enforcement and administration. It is necessary to help grassroots organizations, such as villages and urban communities, administer affairs according to law, in order to push forward the development of democracy at the grassroots level. It is necessary to administer affairs according to law with special stress laid on the efforts to build communities of peace and harmony and to solve the hot and difficult issues of the society.

Television and radio stations, and newspapers and periodicals should start legal programs (including special columns and pages) and carry on the publicity of and education in the legal system in an accurate, popular and lively manner. It is necessary to promote literary and artistic creations on the legal system and improve the quality of such works, in order to steadily increase the appeal of the publicity of and education in the legal system. It is necessary to make full use of the internet in carrying out the publicity of and education in the legal system. Government websites and professional legal publication websites should work hard to become the effective means through which people can learn legal knowledge and receive legal education.

Regional national autonomy is the basic policy adopted by the Communist Party of China for the solution of the national question in China through its application of Marxism-Leninism; it is a basic political system of the State.\nRegional national autonomy means that the minority nationalities, under unified State leadership, practise regional autonomy in areas where they live in concentrated communities and set up organs of self-government for the exercise of the power of autonomy. Regional national autonomy embodies the State's full respect for and guarantee of the right of the minority nationalities to administer their internal affairs and its adherence to the principle of equality, unity and common prosperity for all the nationalities.\nRegional national autonomy has played an enormous role in giving full play to the initiative of all the nationalities as masters of the country, in developing among them a socialist relationship of equality, unity and mutual assistance, in consolidating the unification of the country and in promoting socialist construction in the national autonomous areas and the rest of the country. In the years to come, continued efforts shall be made to uphold and improve the system of regional national autonomy, so that it will play a greater role in the country's socialist modernization drive.\nIt has been proven by practice that adherence to regional national autonomy requires that the national autonomous areas be given effective guarantees for implementing State laws and policies in the light of existing local conditions; that large numbers of cadres at various levels and specialized personnel and skilled workers of various professions and trades be trained from among the minority nationalities; that the national autonomous areas strive to promote local socialist construction in the spirit of self-reliance and hard work and contribute to the nation's construction as a whole; and that the State strive to help the national autonomous areas speed up their economic and cultural development in accordance with the plans for national economic and social development. In the effort to maintain the unity of the nationalities, both big-nation chauvinism, mainly Han chauvinism, and local national chauvinism must be opposed.\nUnder the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory, the people of various nationalities in the autonomous areas shall, together with the people of the whole country, adhere to the people's democratic dictatorship and to the policy of reform and opening to the outside world, march along the road of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics, concentrate their efforts on the socialist modernization drive, develop the socialist market economy, foster the development of socialist democracy and the socialist legal system, enhance socialist cultural and ideological progress, speed up the economic and cultural development of the national autonomous areas, work towards their unity and prosperity and strive for the common prosperity of all the nationalities and for the transformation of China into a prosperous, powerful, democratic and culturally advanced socialist country.\nThe \"Law of the People's Republic of China on Regional National Autonomy\" is the basic law for the implementation of the system of regional national autonomy prescribed in the Constitution.\nChapter I General Provisions\nArticle 1 The Law of the People's Republic of China on Regional National Autonomy is formulated in accordance with the Constitution of the People's Republic of China.\nArticle 2 -Regional autonomy shall be practiced in areas where minority nationalities live in concentrated communities.\nNational autonomous areas shall be classified into autonomous regions, autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties.\nAll national autonomous areas are integral parts of the People's Republic of China.\nArticle 3 Organs of self-government shall be established in national autonomous areas as local organs of the State power at a particular level.\nThe organs of self-government of national autonomous areas shall apply the principle of democratic centralism.\nArticle 4 The organs of self-government of national autonomous areas shall exercise the functions and powers of local organs of the State as specified in Section 5 of Chapter III of the Constitution.

For convenience's sake, these directions shall take the circumstances where the staff is on the left as the basis for illustration. Where the staff is on the right, the word \"left\" used in these directions shall all be changed to \"right\", while the word \"right\" referring to direction shall all be changed to \"left\".\n(1) The face of the Flag shall be red and rectangular; the proportion of its length and height shall be 3 to 2. The upper left of the face of the Flag shall be studded with five yellow five-pointed stars. One of the stars shall be bigger than the others, with its circumcircle's diametre being three-tenth of the height of the Flag, and shall be placed in the left; the four other stars shall be smaller, with their circumcircle's diametre being one-tenth of the height of the Flag, encircling the big star on its right in the shape of an arch. The cover of the staff shall be white.\n(2) The five stars shall be positioned and drawn as follows:\na. To determine the position of the five stars, the face of the Flag shall be first folded both ways to form four equal rectangles; then the rectangle on the upper left shall be vertically divided into ten equal sections and horizontally divided into fifteen equal sections.\nb. The central point of the big five-pointed star shall be at a point in the rectangle where the fifth line from above (or the fifth line from below), and the fifth line from the left (or the tenth line from the right) meet. The method of drawing shall be: taking this point as the centre and the length of three such equals as the radius to make a circle. On the circumference of this circle, five points with equal distances from each other shall be determined, one of the points must be in the right above position of the circle. Then connect each of the five points with every other point to form a straight line respectively. The outline formed by these five straight lines shall be the required big five-pointed star. An angle of the five-pointed star shall point in the right above direction.\nc. The centres of the four small five-pointed stars shall be as follows: the first shall be at a point, in the rectangle, where the second line from above (or the eighth line from below), and the tenth line from the left (or the fifth line from the right) meet; the second shall be at a point where the fourth line from above (or the sixth line from below), and the twelfth line from the left (or the third line from the right) meet; the third shall be at a point where the seventh line from above (or the third line from below), and the twelfth line from the left (or the third line from the right) meet; the fourth shall be at a point where the ninth line from above (or the first line from below), and the tenth line from the left (or the fifth line from the right) meet. The method for drawing shall be: taking each of the above four points as the centre and the length of one such equal as the radius to make four circles. On each circle, five points with equal distances from each other shall be determined. One of such points must be on the line linking the centre of the circle with the centre of the big five-pointed star. Then the same methods used in forming the big five-pointed star shall be used to form the small five-pointed stars. The four small five-pointed stars shall respectively have an angle pointing right at the centre of the big five-pointed star.\n(3) The measurement in common use for the National Flag, from which people from various circles may choose at their discretion shall be as follows:\na. 288 cm. in length, 192 cm. in height;\nb. 240 cm. in length, 160 cm. in height;\nc. 192 cm. in length, 128 cm. in height;\nd. 144 cm. in length, 96 cm. in height;\ne. 96 cm. in length, 64 cm. in height.\n"

It is in order to respond to the report submitted by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in accordance with the relevant provisions of Article 43 and those of Category (2) of Article 48 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China that the State Council has put forward the proposal. In view of the fact that the issue raised in the proposal concerns the interpretation of the relevant articles of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China by the Court of Final Appeal of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in its judgment made on January 29, 1999, that these provisions concern affairs which are the responsibility of the Central Authorities and the relationship between the Central Authorities and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, that the Court of Final Appeal, before making its judgment, failed to seek an interpretation of the provisions from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 3 in Article 158 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China and that the interpretation of the Court of Final Appeal is not in conformity with the original legislative intent, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, after consulting its Committee for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, decides to give the following interpretations to the relevant provisions in the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China in accordance with the provisions of Category (4) of Article 67 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and Paragraph 1 in Article 158 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China:\n1.The provisions of Paragraph 4 in Article 22 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China \" for entry into the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, people from other parts of China must apply for approval\", mean that persons from provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government, including the children of permanent residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region born in the mainland with Chinese nationality, who request to enter the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region with whatever reason shall, in accordance with the provisions of relevant laws and administrative regulations of the State, apply for approval from the relevant government department in the place of their residence and may only enter the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region with valid certificates issued by relevant authorities. It's illegal for any persons or children mentioned above to enter the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region without going through due approval procedures in accordance with the provisions of relevant laws and administrative regulations of the State.\n2.The first three categories of Paragraph 2 in Article 24 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China provide: \" The permanent residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be: (1) Chinese citizens born in Hong Kong before or after the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region; (2) Chinese citizens who have ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for a continuous period of not less than seven years before or after the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region; (3) Persons of Chinese nationality born outside Hong Kong of those residents listed in categories (1) and (2)\".\" Among these people, the persons provided for in Category (3) \" Persons of Chinese nationality born outside Hong Kong of those residents listed in categories (1) and (2)\" mean that those persons, at the time of their birth, no matter whether they were born before or after the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, whose parents or whose fathers or mothers are Chinese citizens as provided for in Category (1) or Category (2) of Paragraph 2 in Article 24 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The original legislative intent elucidated by this Interpretation and the original legislative intent of the other categories of Paragraph 2 in Article 24 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have been embodied in the Opinions on the Implementation of the Second Paragraph of Article 24 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, which were adopted at the Fourth Plenary Meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the National People's Congress on August 10, 1996.\nAfter promulgation of this Interpretation, the courts of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall, in applying the relevant articles of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, follow this Interpretation. This Interpretation does not affect the right of abode in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region granted to the litigating party in the case through the judgment made by the Court of Final Appeal of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on January 29, 1999. As to whether any other person conforms to the provisions of Category (3) of Paragraph 2 in Article 24 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the matter shall be decided according to this Interpretation.\n"

Taking into account the historical background and the reality of Hong Kong, an interpretation regarding implementation of the Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is made as follows:\n1. Any Hong Kong resident who is an ethnic Chinese born in the territory of China (including Hong Kong), and any other person who meets the conditions for Chinese nationality as prescribed by the Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China are Chinese nationals.\n2. All Chinese compatriots residing in Hong Kong, whether they are holders of the British Dependent Territories Citizens' Passport or the British National (Overseas) Passport, are Chinese nationals.

        "text": "Decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Issues Relating to the Methods for Selecting the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in2007 and for Forming the Legislative Council of the HKSAR in2008\n\n\n \n(Adopted at the 9th Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Tenth National People's Congress on April 26, 2004)\nAt its 9th Meeting, the Standing Committee of the Tenth National People's Congress examined the Report on Whether There Is a Need to Amend the Methods for Selecting the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 2007 and for Forming the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 2008, submitted by Tung Chee-hwa, the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, on April 15, 2004 and, before the meeting, had consulted deputies to the National People's Congress and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, people from different sectors of Hong Kong, Hong Kong members of the Committee for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region under the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and the Constitutional Development Task Force of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and had, at the same time, sought the advice of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council. In the course of examination, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress paid full attention to the recent concerns of the Hong Kong community about the methods for selecting the Chief Executive and for forming the Legislative Council after the year 2007, including the views of some bodies and public figures that they wish to see the selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage in the year 2007 and the election of all the members of the Legislative Council by universal suffrage in the year 2008.\nThe participants hold that the provisions in Articles 45 and 68 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China (hereinafter referred to as the Basic Law of Hong Kong, in short) already expressly stipulate that the methods for selecting the Chief Executive and for forming the Legislative Council shall be prescribed in the light of the actual situation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress, and that the ultimate aims are the selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures and the election of all the members of the Legislative Council by universal suffrage. The methods for selecting the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and for forming the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall conform to the principles and provisions of the Basic Law of Hong Kong mentioned above. Any change relating to the methods for selecting the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and for forming the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall conform to the principles that it is compatible with the social, economic and political development of Hong Kong and that it is conducive to the balanced participation of all strata, sectors and groups of the society, to the effective operation of the executive-led system, and to the maintenance of long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.\nThe participants hold that since the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Hong Kong residents have enjoyed democratic rights that they had never had before. The first Chief Executive was elected by the Selection Committee, which was composed of 400 members. The second Chief Executive was elected by the Election Committee, which was composed of 800 members. Out of the 60 members of the Legislative Council, the number of members returned by geographical constituencies through direct elections has increased from 20 in the Legislative Council in the first term to 24 in the Legislative Council in the second term and will reach 30 in the Legislative Council in the third term to be formed in September this year. Hong Kong does not have a long history of practising democratic elections, and it is not seven years yet since Hong Kong residents exercised the democratic right to participate in the selection of the Chief Executive of the Special Administrative Region. Since the return of Hong Kong to the motherland, the number of members of the Legislative Council returned by geographical constituencies through direct elections has increased by a fairly wide margin. When the setup is such that half of the members are returned by geographical constituencies through direct elections and the other half by functional constituencies, the impact on the operation of the Hong Kong society as a whole, especially the impact on the executive-led system, remains to be tested through practice. Moreover, at present, different sectors of the Hong Kong society have considerable differences on how to determine the methods for selecting the Chief Executive and for forming the Legislative Council after the year 2007 and have not come to a broad consensus. Such being the case, the conditions do not yet exist for the selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures, as provided for in Article 45 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong, or for the election of all the members of the Legislative Council by universal suffrage, as provided for in Article 68 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong.\nIn view of the above and pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Basic Law of Hong Kong and the Interpretation by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of Annex I (7) and Annex II (III) to the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress makes the following decision on the methods for selecting the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the year 2007 and for forming the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the year 2008:\n(1) The election of the third Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to be held in the year 2007 shall not be conducted by means of universal suffrage. The election of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the fourth term in the year 2008 shall not be conducted by means of an election of all the members by universal suffrage, the ratio between the members returned by functional constituencies and the members returned by geographical constituencies through direct elections, who shall respectively occupy half of the seats, is to remain unchanged, and the procedures for voting on bills and motions in the Legislative Council are to remain unchanged.\n(2) On the premise that Decision (1) is not contravened, appropriate amendments that conform to the principle of gradual and orderly progress may be made to the specific method for selecting the third Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the year 2007 and the specific method for forming the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the fourth term in the year 2008, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 45 and 68 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong and the provisions of Annex I (7) and Annex II (III) to the Basic Law of Hong Kong.\nThe participants hold that developing democracy in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the light of the actual situation and in a gradual and orderly manner according to the provisions of the Basic Law of Hong Kong has been the unswerving, consistent position of the Central Authorities. Along with the development and progress in all aspects of the Hong Kong society and through the joint endeavors of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Hong Kong residents, the democratic system of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will certainly progress incessantly, and ultimately attain the aims of selecting the Chief Executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures and electing all the members of the Legislative Council by universal suffrage, as provided for in the Basic Law of Hong Kong.\n"

The people of all of China's nationalities have jointly created a culture of grandeur and have a glorious revolutionary tradition.\nAfter 1840, feudal China was gradually turned into a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country. The Chinese people waged many successive heroic struggles for national independence and liberation and for democracy and freedom.\nGreat and earthshaking historical changes have taken place in China in the 20th century.\nThe Revolution of 1911, led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, abolished the feudal monarchy and gave birth to the Republic of China. But the historic mission of the Chinese people to overthrow imperialism and feudalism remained unaccomplished.\nAfter waging protracted and arduous struggles, armed and otherwise, along a zigzag course, the Chinese people of all nationalities led by the Communist Party of China with Chairman Mao Zedong as its leader ultimately, in 1949, overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism, won a great victory in the New-Democratic Revolution and founded the People's Republic of China. Since then the Chinese people have taken control of state power and become masters of the country.\nAfter the founding of the People's Republic, China gradually achieved its transition from a New-Democratic to a socialist society. The socialist transformation of the private ownership of the means of production has been completed, the system of exploitation of man by man abolished and the socialist system established. The people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, which is in essence the dictatorship of the proletariat, has been consolidated and developed. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army have defeated imperialist and hegemonist aggression, sabotage and armed provocations and have thereby safeguarded China's national independence and security and strengthened its national defence. Major successes have been achieved in economic development. An independent and relatively comprehensive socialist system of industry has basically been established. There has been a marked increase in agricultural production. Significant advances have been made in educational, scientific and cultural undertakings, while education in socialist ideology has produced noteworthy results. The life of the people has improved considerably.\nThe victory in China's New-Democratic Revolution and the successes in its socialist cause have been achieved by the Chinese people of all nationalities, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, by upholding truth, correcting errors and surmounting numerous difficulties and hardships. China will be in the primary stage of socialism for a long time to come. The basic task of the nation is to concentrate its effort on socialist modernization along the road of Chinese-style socialism. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of Three Represents, the Chinese people of all nationalities will continue to adhere to the people's democratic dictatorship and the socialist road, persevere in reform and opening to the outside world, steadily improve socialist institutions, develop the socialist market economy, develop socialist democracy, improve the socialist legal system and work hard and self-reliantly to modernize the country's industry, agriculture, national defence and science and technology step by step and promote the coordinated development of the material, political and spiritual civilizations, to turn China into a socialist country that is prosperous, powerful, democratic and culturally advanced.\nThe exploiting classes as such have been abolished in our country. However, class struggle will continue to exist within certain bounds for a long time to come. The Chinese people must fight against those forces and elements, both at home and abroad, that are hostile to China's socialist system and try to undermine it.\nTaiwan is part of the sacred territory of the People's Republic of China. It is the inviolable duty of all Chinese people, including our compatriots in Taiwan, to accomplish the great task of reunifying the motherland.\nIn building socialism it is essential to rely on workers, peasants and intellectuals and to unite all forces that can be united.

This united front will continue to be consolidated and developed. The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a broadly based representative organization of the united front which has played a significant historical role, will play a still more important role in the country's political and social life, in promoting friendship with other countries and in the struggle for socialist modernization and for the reunification and unity of the country.

Socialist relations of equality, unity and mutual assistance have been established among the nationalities and will continue to be strengthened.

The State will do its utmost to promote the common prosperity of all the nationalities.\nChina's achievements in revolution and construction are inseparable from the support of the people of the world. The future of China is closely linked to the future of the world. China consistently carries out an independent foreign policy and adheres to the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence in developing diplomatic relations and economic and cultural exchanges with other countries. China consistently opposes imperialism, hegemonism and colonialism, works to strengthen unity with the people of other countries, supports the oppressed nations and the developing countries in their just struggle to win and preserve national independence and develop their national economies, and strives to safeguard world peace and promote the cause of human progress.\nThis Constitution, in legal form, affirms the achievements of the struggles of the Chinese people of all nationalities and defines the basic system and basic tasks of the State; it is the fundamental law of the State and has supreme legal authority.

Email: nc.ude.unb@iyoaixuhCopyright © The British Society of Developmental Disabilities 2020AbstractAs more and more evidence accrues in support of family-centered approaches to disability services, parents’ experiences raising children with disabilities is receiving increasing attention internationally. The literature on parents of children with disabilities, however—whether intellectual disability (ID) or other chronic health conditions (OCHC)—tends to focus on mothers as the primary research subject. To address the paucity of research focused on fathers’ experiences of raising a child with disabilities, I surveyed over 4500 fathers of children with disabilities in Mainland China. The surveys focused on fathers’ perceptions of their children, their perceptions of family functioning, and their perceptions of their own needs for emotional support. Results derived from statistical analyses of the data suggest that fathers tend to believe their children with ID are harder to raise than other children, and that they more often do things that irritate them and make them feel angry. Fathers of children with ID also tend to perceive their family functioning as somewhat problematic. Generally, these fathers are disinclined to seek emotional support from outside their families, although fathers from the majority Han population and fathers who have greater than high school education are more likely to seek support than are fathers from minority ethnic groups and fathers with lower educational background. Comparisons are made with fathers of children with OCHC. Implications of the findings are identified and lines of further research suggested.Keywords: Children with ID, emotional support, family functioning, fathers, perceptionIntellectual disability (ID) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by ineffective intellectual and adaptive functioning of varying severity and originating before 18 years of age (American Psychiatric Association 2013). Literature about raising children with ID indicates that parents shoulder tremendous responsibilities and face multiple demands in their daily lives as they seek to educate and care for their children with ID (Emerson 2003, Herring et al.\n2006). This literature focuses largely on mothers as the primary research subjects (Flippin and Crais 2011), although those few studies that have focused on fathers’ involvement with children with ID have demonstrated that fathers can also have favorable and positive outcomes on both child development (Boström and Broberg 2014, Laxman et al.\n2015) and maternal adjustment (Simmerman et al.\n2001). While their roles vary from one country to another, and among families, studies show that in recent decades fathers have become more engaged than they were in past generations with childcare, in dealing with professionals from disability-related services, and in interacting with children with ID both internationally (Carpenter and Towers 2008, Pleck 2010) and in China (Ministry of Civil Affairs 2019).As family-centered approaches to providing support services for children with disabilities become ever more widely adopted (see, for example, Mas et al. 2019), the roles of fathers as well as mothers take on added significance. Family systems theory—the notion that families are complex, emotionally connected units that require the application of systems thinking to understand the interactions of its members (Kerr 2000)—provides a rationale for researching those roles and interactions ever more strenuously. Thus, as fathers take on more multifaceted roles in families and play more important roles in caring for children with ID, it becomes increasingly important to explore their experiences of parenting children with ID and their role in overall family functioning (Wang and Hu 2014). Turnbull et al. (2018), for example, report that fathers can adapt well to the challenges of raising children with ID, that they can partner with mothers and other family members, and positively seek various types of support, in the process enhancing holistic family functioning. Yet, there is a paucity of research that addresses fathers’ experiences of raising children with ID, their roles in family life, and their emotional support needs. This research I report here adds to current knowledge in this area through analyses of the perceptions of fathers of children with ID in China where individuals with ID are estimated to number 5.680c million (Chinese Disabled Persons’ Federation 2012). The use of a national data set (a sample of over 4500 fathers drawn from the population of Mainland China), and statistical analyses of quantitative data sets this study apart from most others in this area which rely on small sample sizes and qualitative data.Fathers’ experiences of raising children with IDRaising a child with ID can exert unexpected challenges on parents and affect both individual and overall family well-being (Hauser-Cram et al.\n2013). Numerous studies have demonstrated that fathers of children with disabilities experience higher levels of stress, sleeplessness, and shame than fathers of typically developing children (Dabrowska and Pisula 2010, Hornby 1992, Olsson and Hwang 2001). American fathers of children with Down Syndrome, for example, experienced elevated levels of stress associated with parenting (Roach et al.\n1999) as did Irish fathers who sometimes refused to accept their children’s diagnosis of ID (Marsh et al.\n2018). Huang et al. (2014) found that parental stress affected the quality of life of fathers of children with ID living within Chinese culture and that those fathers also experienced poorer physical and mental health than other fathers.While most studies of fathers who are caring for a child with ID shows that fathers experience high levels of stress and shame, a few recent studies have demonstrated different findings. In a review of literature, Davys and colleagues (2017) reported that a child’s diagnosis of ID sometimes has no impact on fathers’ stress levels, and that fathers sometimes have positive responses towards their child’s ID and become empowered and more resilient. In a five-year study of seven fathers of children with ID in Sweden, Boström and Broberg (2014) also found that children with ID may have positive effects on their parents, despite the tremendous responsibilities for childcare and household duties those parents face. Studies of factors that contribute to fathers’ responses to children with ID suggest that children’s behavior rather than disability status is the more significant factor determining fathers’ reported stress levels (Cohen et al.\n2016, Kumar and Joshi 2015).The role of fathers in raising children with ID may be particularly important in its impact on overall family functioning. As determined by the cohesion of family members and the ability of parents to adapt to caring for children with ID, family functioning has been one of the most frequently investigated factors contributing to well-being and quality of life for families of children with ID (Turnbull et al.\n2018). Al‐Krenawi et al. (2011), for example, demonstrated that Bedouin-Arab families of children with ID report a lower level of family functioning—that is, more problematic functioning, less marital satisfaction, more caregiver burden, and a lower sense of family coherence—than do families of typically developing children. Others have also shown that the challenging behaviors of children with ID have a negative impact on family functioning (Povee et al.\n2012, Yıldırım et al. 2013). A recent study of fathers of children with Down Syndrome illustrated that although fathers employed strategies to achieve positive adjustment to their children, there was nevertheless a negative impact on overall family functioning (Ridding and Williams 2019).Emotional support for fathers of children with disabilitiesFamily support is critical in ensuring that families with children with disabilities can effectively access educational programming and disability-related services, and maintain overall family functioning (Kyzar et al.\n2012). Kyzar and her colleagues identify four types of family support: physical support, including health and daily living activities; material support, including financial resources and assistance with tasks; informational support; and emotional support. Emotional support—improving psychosocial functioning, reducing stress, and promoting positive feelings (Kyzar et al.\n2012)—seems to be the predominant type of support needed (McWilliam and Scott 2001). Certainly, it can contribute to family cohesion and adaptation, thereby enhancing overall family functioning (Turnbull et al.\n2018).The family research literature has a long history of studies that document the emotional needs of families of children with disabilities internationally (Boyd et al.\n2019, Shannon 2004). As noted in the introduction to this paper, however, this research has tended to focus on understanding emotional support from the perspective of mothers with children with disabilities (e.g. Brotherson et al.\n2010) and has paid less attention to fathers’ perspectives on and needs for emotional support. Certainly, mothers are more likely than fathers to seek support in dealing with the stress, emotional intensity, and burden of parenting (Hu 2016). A Finnish study showed that fathers of children with ID use coping strategies less frequently and less positively than do mothers (Saloviita et al.\n2003), and a Polish study that fathers of children with Down Syndrome are less likely than their spouses to seek emotional support from outside sources (Dabrowska and Pisula 2010). Huang et al. (2012) also found that fathers’ experiences of parenting children with ID appear to differ from mothers’ experiences: While mothers experience a loss of ability to control planning for the family’s future, and experience a lack of emotional regulation strategies to support their work with their children with ID, fathers experience poorer mental wellbeing, in part because of elevated stress, and poorer physical health often accompanied by chronic illness.Fathers may well be less willing than mothers to share their experiences and coping strategies with researchers (Boyd et al.\n2019) but, as well, research on fathers of children with ID has tended to emphasize the negative aspects of the fathers’ experiences. The literature has not yet explored the full range of perceptions that fathers have of their children with ID nor has it ventured far into exploring the emotional supports that fathers could access to help them cope with parenting challenges. Certainly, it is not clear how fathers perceive emotional support or what might encourage them to seek sources of such support (Brotherson et al.\n2010). Boström and Broberg (2014), examining Swedish fathers of children with ID, clearly identified a need to provide psychological support for fathers, respond to their emotional needs, and identify mechanisms for coping with stress. Research focused on fathers’ perceptions of their children and of family functioning, therefore, and of their own needs for emotional support, is warranted. Gaining a better understanding of fathers’ perceptions and needs may inform the development of coping mechanisms and more targeted supports for fathers, and thereby improve their health and the well-being of the entire family.Current studyHistorically, fathers of children with ID have been under-researched and under-serviced in China, as elsewhere. Fathers dealing with the stress of raising children with disabilities have only informally organized parent groups to which to turn for emotional support (China Association of Persons with Psychiatric Disability and their Relatives 2014). In order to identify and develop additional strategies to support the emotional needs of fathers, an initial step is to explore fathers’ perceptions of children with ID as well as their perceptions of their families’ functioning and of their own needs for emotional support. The research questions addressed in this study are: (1) What are Chinese fathers’ perceptions of their children with ID, and of their families’ functioning? (2) To what extent do Chinese fathers of children with ID seek sources of emotional support? (3) What factors might predispose fathers of children with ID to seek sources of emotional support?MethodParticipantsTo recruit participants for this study, I engaged local agencies for disability affairs throughout the 34 provinces of Mainland China to distribute flyers inviting fathers to participate in a national study investigating the health of children with disabilities. The flyers explained that the study concerned fathers’ perceptions of their child, their levels of satisfaction with any supports provided to the family, and their levels of satisfaction with overall family functioning, as well as the fathers’ own health needs. Fathers expressed their interest in participating by sending an email message either to the local agency or directly to the researchers.A total of 2549 Chinese fathers of children with ID, aged 2 to 17, and a total of 2008 fathers of children with OCHC, also aged 2 to 17, participated in this study. Table 1 details the demographic characteristics of the sample. The average age of fathers of children with ID is 46 years, and of fathers of children with OCHC, 43 years. A smaller proportion of the former group is urban (60.4% vs. 70.6%), and of Han ethnicity (60.1% vs. 76.1%); a smaller proportion was educated beyond high school (61.6% vs. 71.1%); and a smaller proportion falls into the highest income bracket (as measured the 2018 China Bureau of Statistics 2018) with a yearly income of greater than 20,000 Chinese yuan (29.2% vs. 42.0%). The proportion of each group that is married is about the same—87.9% for the former, 86.1% for the latter.Table 1.Descriptive statistics of father and child characteristics.A.

Local agencies for disability affairs sent each father who had expressed willingness to participate a large envelope containing a series of questionnaires and a consent form. The consent form instructed the fathers to complete the questionnaires independently and to return them with the consent form either to the local agencies or directly to the researchers within one month.MeasuresChild perceptions and family function short form This standardized scale was developed at the Institute of Education of Beijing Normal University (Hu 2016). Its purpose is to determine Chinese families’ perceptions of their children’s disabilities and their perceptions of overall family functioning. The scale consists of seven items each of which is to be rated on a 4-point Likert scale. The total scale has a Cronbach’s ɑ of .89, and the domains range from .88 to .93. Split-half reliability coefficients range from .82 to .90 for the domains and from .82 to .83 for the total scale. Concerning their perceptions of their children, fathers responded ‘never, rarely, sometimes, usually or always’ to three questions:\nDuring the past month, how often have you felt that this child is much harder to care for than most children his or her age?During the past month, how often have you felt that this child does things that really irritate you a lot?During the past month, how often were you angry with this child?Concerning their perceptions of family functioning, fathers responded ‘all of the time, most of the time, some of the time, or none of the time’ to each part of a four-part question: When your family faces problems, how often are you likely to a) talk together about what to do?

(d) stay hopeful?Emotional support questionnaire for Chinese families with children with disabilities The emotional support questionnaire for Chinese families with children with disabilities is a non-standardized questionnaire developed using a Delphi method (a technique for obtaining consensus within a group through hierarchical task analysis) by a panel of experts in family studies of children with disabilities from the Chinese Association of Persons with Disabilities. The 11-item questionnaire assesses families’ levels of physical, mental, and emotional health on a 5-point Likert scale (excellent, very good, good, fair, poor). Participants were also asked if they had someone they ‘could turn to for day-to-day emotional support with parenting or raising children,’ and, if so, who or what that was: (a) spouse, (b) other family member or close friend, (c) health care provider, (d) place of worship or religious leader, (e) support or advocacy group related to specific health condition, (f) peer support group, (g) counselor or other mental health professional, (h) other. A new categorical variable was created to summarize the number of emotional support sources the participants utilized: 0-2, 3-5, or 6 or more. Based on the current sample, the Cronbach’s ɑ for the total stress scores across subscales was .90.Covariates Demographic characteristics of fathers and their children provided the covariates examined in this study. These included, for the children, the severity of the child’s ID (mild, moderate, or severe) as well as the child’s location (urban or rural), ethnicity (Han or Minority), gender (male or female), and age. For the fathers, covariates included age, marital status, and level of education (more or less than high school), and, rated on Likert scales, physical health, mental health, and income.Data analysisDescriptive and regression analyses were conducted using IBM’s Complex Sample Package in SPSS, 26th edition (IBM 2018), a program that incorporates sample designs into survey analysis. A plan file was created with information specifying the sampling procedure and weights to account for non-respondents and missing values. Cross tabulations were then produced showing fathers’ perceptions of their children, of family functioning, and of their own need for emotional support.The distribution of fathers’ perceptions, stratified by children’s’ type of disability (ID and OCHC), is presented as weighted proportions in order to help us better describe fathers’ perceptions with a point of reference. To determine if fathers’ perceptions of their children differ based on type of disability (ID vs. OCHC), chi square statistics were computed for the test of independence of the row and column variables. To determine what factors increase the likelihood of fathers’ choosing to seek sources of emotional support (a binary variable with yes/no as answers), the weighted logistic regression procedure was performed with father level characteristics (education, physical health, mental health, age, marital status) in model one and child level characteristics (age, gender, race, ethnicity, severity of ID) in model two. Model three including with both father and child level characteristics was tested but this model did not converge. Model goodness-of-fit was measured by Cox-Snell R2 (Cox and Snell 1981).ResultsFathers’ perceptions of children with disabilitiesTable 2 illustrates fathers’ perceptions of raising children with ID or children with OCHC. Overall, fathers of children with ID believe it is harder to raise their children than do fathers of children with OCHC. The differences are significant with χ2(1, N = 14,943) = 1486.1, p < .001. Fathers of children with ID are also more likely than fathers of children with OCHC to report that their children do things that irritate them (difference significant with χ2(1, N = 14,923) = 867.3, p < .001) and that they more often feel irritated or angry with them (difference significant with χ2(1, N = 14,913) = 80.5, p = .009).Table 2.Descriptive statistics of fathers’ perceptions of children with ID and OCHC. Child with ID %SEChild with OCHC %SEChi-square\ndf\n\np\nChild is much harder to care for than most children1486.114943.000Never3.82.269.60.8   Rarely3.91.718.90.7   Sometimes36.214.39.20.5   Usually or always56.113.12.30.2   Father felt child does things that bother them867.314923.000Never14.75.048.80.9   Rarely13.64.235.50.9   Sometimes35.010.314.00.6   Usually or always36.614.31.70.2   Father felt angry with child during the past month80.514913.009Never18.75.938.50.9   Rarely38.710.846.10.9   Sometimes42.613.314.70.6   Usually or always000.60.1   Open in a separate windowFamily functioningOverall, fewer fathers of children with ID feel healthy, physically and emotionally, than fathers of children with OCHC. 47.0% of fathers of children with ID feel in excellent or very good physical health compared to 67.5% of fathers of children with OCHC; 71% of fathers of children with ID believe they are in excellent or very good mental health compared to 85% of fathers of children with OCHC.Table 3 presents the results of fathers’ perceptions of overall family functioning. Compared to fathers of children with OCHC, fathers of children with ID are less likely to talk together with family members (spouses, child with ID, other children, or extended family members) or to work together all the time or most of the time to solve their child’s problems (differences significant, χ2 (1, N = 14,832) = 393.0, p < .001 and χ2(1, N = 14,931) = 60.9, p = .034). Fathers of children with ID are also less likely than fathers of children with OCHC to know, all of the time or most of the time, that they have strengths to draw on to solve problems (difference significant, χ2(1, N = 14,901) = 129.8, p < .001) or, all of the time or most of the time, that they can to stay hopeful in difficult times (difference significant, χ2(1, N = 14,902) = 196.2, p < .001).Table 3.Descriptive statistics of fathers’ perceptions of family functioning. Child with IDChild with OCHCChi-square\ndf\n\np\n \n%\n\nSE\n\n%\n\nSE\n   How Often Talk Together 393.014832.000All of the time32.610.143.60.9   Most of the time30.78.642.70.9   Some of the time15.15.612.60.6   None of the time21.617.01.20.3   How Often Work Together   60.914931.034All of the time31.99.745.00.9   Most of the time34.19.243.20.9   Some of the time33.014.911.10.6   None of the time1.10.90.80.2   How Often Draw on Strengths   129.814901.000All of the time41.111.150.50.9   Most of the time20.46.139.90.9   Some of the time37.214.28.70.5   None of the time1.30.91.00.2   How Often Stay Hopeful  196.214902.000All of the time43.111.355.60.9   Most of the time23.76.738.80.9   Some of the time32.914.95.00.3   None of the time0.20.30.50.1   Open in a separate windowEmotional supportTable 4 summarizes descriptive statistics concerning emotional support for fathers facing problems raising a child with ID or OCHC.

Fathers in both groups most frequently turn to family members or friends, usually a spouse, for emotional support, and are less likely to seek emotional support from professionals such as counselors or health care providers.Table 4.Descriptive statistics of fathers’ perceptions of emotional support.  Father of Children with IDFather with Children with OCHCChi-square\ndf\n\np\n \n%\n\nSE\n\n%\n\nSE\n\n%\n \nSE\nSomeone to Turn to for Emotional Support55.613.269.60.911.4 .255# of emotional support sources0-235.410.658.51.034.614962.0033-554.810.539.50.9   6-89.84.01.90.3   Emotional support sourcesSpouse93.12.989.80.60.914932.353Health Care Provider40.210.221.50.815.614932.029Other Family or Friend75.210.980.10.81.214932.622Place of Worship47.510.530.90.99.614932.090 Health Condition Support Group26.87.63.10.4133.814932.000 Peer Support Group27.08.810.10.623.614891.005 Counselor15.46.67.40.57.014932.099 Other0.60.61.70.30.514932.254Open in a separate windowLogistic regression analyses (Table 5) suggest that fathers’ predispositions to seek emotional support is related to ethnic identity and to the father’s own educational background.

The empirical evidence presented here, based on a large sample size from across China, demonstrates that fathers of children with ID tend to have less positive perceptions of their children than do fathers of children with OCHC. 56.1% of fathers of children with ID believe their children are usually or always harder to raise than other children, while only 2.3% of fathers of children with OCHC feel this way. Fathers of children with ID are more likely than fathers of children with OCHC to report that their children often do things that irritate them (36.6% vs.1.7%) and that they more often feel angry towards their children (45.6% vs. 15.3).This is one of only a few studies to use fathers’ perceptions of family functioning to examine overall well-being of families of children with ID. Compared to fathers of children with OCHC, fewer fathers of children with ID believe that the family, when facing problems, would talk together with other family members (63.3% vs. 86.3%), work together to solve their child’s problem (66.0% vs. 88.0%), have strengths to draw on to solve problems (61.5% vs. 90.4%), or stay hopeful in difficult times (66.8% vs. 94.4%). These results indicate that, for fathers of children with ID, family functioning can be problematic. A possible explanation is that distinct challenges associated with ID cause fathers to be overly occupied with their children’s maladaptive behaviors (Marsh et al.\n2018) and thereby have less time and opportunity to interact with their spouses.When facing problems raising their children with ID or OCHC, fathers tend to rely on family members or friends as primary sources of emotional support. This finding is consistent with earlier studies that show that support providers primarily come from inside the family (Turnbull et al.\n2018, Kyzar et al.\n2012), as well as with family systems theory and its concept of the closeness and integrity of the family unit. However, only about half (55.6%) the fathers of children with ID would seek emotional support at all. As well, the number of emotional support resources used differed between fathers of children with ID and fathers of children with OCHC. Interestingly, disparity also exists based on the child’s ethnicity (OR = 2.94) and father’s educational background (OR = 16.82).This study is the first to provide empirical evidence that Chinese fathers of children with ID do not willingly seek outside emotional support. A recent national report on family needs of children with autism also showed that, compared to mothers, fathers feel hesitant to speak about their needs and hesitant to seek support from outside the family (China Association of Persons with Psychiatric Disability and their Relatives 2014). One explanation might be that emotional support has long been regarded as an informal type of support that, in traditional Chinese culture, comes from within a family unit. Thus, Chinese fathers would be unlikely even to consider going outside the family to seek emotional support and would rarely seek it from sources such as psychological counseling, parent organizations, or other family support groups. This study is also the first to identify factors that predispose fathers in China to seek emotional support. Ethnicity and educational background clearly play a role.This study did not explore fathers’ coping strategies or ability to get access to social support. A literature review of fathers of children with ID (Davys et al.\n2017) suggests that fathers are more likely to seek support in the form of information or to seek social services that support their children rather than to seek emotional support for themselves. Future studies should identify coping strategies and other family supports that fathers might draw upon to assist them in caring for a child with ID.Several limitations to this study are worth mentioning. The paucity of validated data collection tools and the limited number of items available for use in the surveys constrained the depth of information that could be collected and the depth of the individual perspectives that could be obtained. Additional observable survey items might improve the measure’s content validity, and more advanced analysis at the factor/construct level might reveal additional insights. Although logistic regression analyses indicate that fathers’ predisposition to seeking sources of emotional support significantly differs based on ethnicity and educational background, the large confidence interval that includes the null value of one indicates that this result should perhaps be considered inconclusive. Finally, this study does not identify the type of supports fathers need or would value, nor does it compare the perceptions of fathers of children with ID with the perceptions of fathers of typically developing children or with mothers of children with ID. Future studies should address these issues in order to provide broader insights on policymaking as well as on disability-related services and practices.ImplicationsSeveral important implications can be derived from the study. First, efforts should be devoted to identifying adaptive strategies that support Chinese fathers’ positive perceptions of their children with ID, and of their families. Increased awareness of the strengths and needs of their children with ID and of support services available to children and their families might encourage fathers to access emotional supports and result in more positive perceptions of their children. To this end, government agencies or NGOs representing rural or minority ethnic groups might devote efforts to creating support groups and identifying ways to assist fathers to connect with each other or with professionals or other service providers. Second, because Chinese fathers of children with ID are not strongly inclined to seek emotional support at all, especially those from rural areas and those with low educational background, targeted supports that can address their particular emotional needs and expand their social networking is likely to prove worthwhile (Davys et al.\n2017 ). These supports might include parent support groups, counseling, and mental health services. Moreover, family support services should be made available within all communities, should use multiple means to reach out to, connect with, and support fathers, and should help fathers realize the potential benefits of emotional support in promoting their own physical and psychological wellbeing. Finally, because those fathers of children with ID who do seek support tend to seek it through several different sources, service providers should ensure that multiple sources of support are available.Further research should also address the quality of support available to fathers, not just the number of supports. It is not clear whether Chinese fathers of children with ID who seek multiple sources of support do so because they need and want multiple sources or because they do not receive sufficient or satisfactory support from those services already available to them. Identifying the types of support or support strategies that Chinese father’s need or might value would better inform Chinese service providers in designing, developing, and delivering support to fathers. Addressing fathers’ unique needs with preferred support strategies could facilitate targeted support that would better promote overall family functioning in China.In summary: This study is the first to report a large-scale investigation of fathers’ perceptions of children with ID, their perceptions of family functioning, and their perceptions of their own needs for emotional support. The findings indicate that Chinese fathers of children with ID could benefit from various sources of emotional support to help them deal with the stress of caring for a child with ID. As members of the family unit, fathers’ well-being and emotional health plays a critical role in promoting overall family functioning. Further research in support of fathers of children with ID is, therefore, critically important—to supporting the health of fathers and thereby the wellbeing and overall functioning of thousands of families of children with ID.Funding informationThis research was supported by 2020 Comprehensive Discipline Construction Fund of Faculty of Education, Beijing Normal UniversityChinese fathers of children with intellectual disabilitiesTheir Perceptions of the Child, Family Functioning, and Their Own Needs for Emotional SupportDisclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author.ReferencesAl‐Krenawi, A., Graham, J.

        "text": "OVERVIEW \nGlobal estimate According to the World Disability Report released by the WHO in 2011, at a time marked by continued population growth and aging population trends, the number of persons with disabilities worldwide was on the rise. Disabilities are closely linked to health, economic and environmental factors, and can result from road traffic injuries, humanitarian crisis, and violence. It is estimated that about 15 per cent of the world's population have disabilities. Among children aged 0 –14, it is estimated that 5.1 per cent (about 93 million children) have disabilities, and 0.7 per cent (about 13 million children) have severe disabilities. 1 Due to narrower disability classification criteria used in China, the incidence of disabilities is lower than the global estimates. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities In 2006, the UN adopted the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), which aims to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and promote respect for their inherent dignity. China played an active role as advocate and participant during the negotiation process and the drafting of the CRPD. The Government of China signed the Convention in 2007 and ratified it on 1 August 2008. In August 2010, China submitted its Initial Report on the implementation of the CRPD. \nIn order to align China ’s national legislation with international standards on disability and promote the rights and well-being of persons with disabilities, the Government started a parallel process in 2006 to revise the Law of the People ’s Republic of China on the Protection of Persons with Disabilities, which was enacted in 1990. New provisions for children with disabilities were included in the revised law, which entered into force on 1 July 2008. Statistics on persons with disabilities Data and research on the status of persons with disabilities has provided important evidence for policy development. China conducted the first and second National Sample Survey on Disability in 1987 and 2006, respectively. The 2006 survey, 2 conducted in 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities of mainland China, sampled around 772,000 households and 2.53 million people, including approximately 620,000 children aged 0 –17. The survey found that the total number of persons with disabilities in 2006 was 82.96 million, accounting for 6.3 per cent 3 of China ’s total population. About 6.1 per cent of all persons with disabilities were children, in other words, about five million children have some type of disability, accounting for 1.6 per cent of the total number of children in the country. This survey provided nationally representative data and reflected the overall situation of children with disabilities. \nIn order to further monitor the situation of persons with disabilities after the 2006 National Sample Survey on Disability, the China Disabled Persons' Federation (CDPF) continued to monitor the situation nationwide for eight consecutive years from 2007 to 2014, and regularly issued the Monitoring Reports on Disabled People's Situation and Well-off Progress in China. \nSince 2008, the CDPF has combined the issuance of the second-generation People's Republic of China Disability Card with the collection and management of basic population information of persons with disabilities in possession of the Disability Card. Additionally, through the Ministry of Public Security's National Citizenship Information Service System, CDPF oversaw identity authentication and established the National Basic Population Database of Persons with Disabilities. 4 By the end of 2017, the database had basic information on more than 34 million persons with disabilities in possession of the Disability Card, including 1.22 million children with disabilities aged 0 –17. Possessing the Disability Card will increase children ’s access to targeted social services and government support. \nAt the beginning of 2015, the State Council Working Committee on Disability organized the National Special Survey on the Status and Needs of Basic Services for Persons with Disabilities (2015 Special Survey), 5 specifically gathering information on persons with disabilities registered in the Population Database. Subsequent annual updates were conducted, which provided rich data for in-depth analysis of the situation of persons with disabilities, including children with disabilities. Social protection for children with disabilities After decades of hard work, China's social protection system for persons with disabilities has been gradually improved and standardized. The comprehensive system includes five key components: social insurance, social assistance, social welfare, care services and special assistance, promoting the active integration of persons with disabilities in society. The Opinions of the State Council on Establishing a Full-Scale System of Living Subsidies for Disabled Persons with Financial Difficulties and Nursing Subsidies for Persons with Serious Disabilities, issued in 2015, mentions the establishment of a comprehensive system for the two subsidies. This is the first time that China has established a special welfare system for persons with disabilities at the national level. This system has also been effectively linked to other systems such as dibao, filling the previous gap for persons with disabilities in the welfare system. 6 \nAs a key target group in the social protection system for persons with disabilities, children with disabilities enjoy various social assistance 7 and welfare subsidies. 8 According to relevant surveys, there are almost no gender differences among children with disabilities in terms of access to social assistance and welfare subsidies. A higher proportion of children with more severe disabilities enjoy access to dibao and the two subsidies. The proportion of rural children with disabilities accessing medical and educational assistance and welfare subsidies is lower than that of urban children with disabilities. Rehabilitation for children with disabilities In the 1980s, the concept of rehabilitation (rehabilitation and habilitation are closely linked in China, and thus will be referred to hereafter as rehabilitation) was introduced in China, marking the beginning of the development of corresponding services for persons with disabilities. Habilitation and rehabilitation are important for children with disabilities to improve or regain skills, abilities and knowledge “ to attain and maintain maximum independence, full physical, mental, social and vocational ability, and full inclusion and participation in all aspects of life ” (CRPD, article 26). In recent years, the Government has highlighted the issue of rehabilitation for children with disabilities. Specifically, improving rehabilitation services for children with disabilities aged 0 –6 is outlined as a major objective in the National Programme of Action for Children (2011 –2020). In addition, the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan on Accelerating the Process of Persons with Disabilities Toward a Comparatively WellOff Life, the National Action Plan on Disability Prevention (2016 –2020), and the Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation all emphasize the need to strengthen rehabilitation services. \nCompared to the 2006 National Sample Survey, children with disabilities today have improved access to rehabilitation services, however the demand for these services have not been fully met. According to results from the 2015 Special Survey, of the 26 million people and children with disabilities, in possession of a Disability Card, 59.6 per cent required rehabilitation services, but less than 20 per cent received rehabilitation services. 9 The newly released Opinions of the State Council on Establishing a System of Providing Rehabilitation Assistance to Children with Disabilities announces the implementation of a rehabilitation assistance system for children with disabilities from 1 October 2018, with a focus on services not covered by the existing social protection system, and emphasis on effective linkages with basic medical insurance and temporary assistance, ultimately to achieve universal access to rehabilitation services for children with disabilities aged 0 –6 by 2025. 10 Children with disabilities and education Education serves as the foundation for equal participation and inclusive development of children with disabilities. China ’s Law on Compulsory Education stipulates that school-age children with disabilities have the right to receive compulsory education. Moreover, different forms of education should be provided to meet the individual needs of children with disabilities, so they can attend regular and special education classes of regular schools or enroll in special education schools. The Government has vowed to further improve the education system for children with disabilities during the Thirteenth FYP period, by strengthening the foundation for special education development, actively promoting inclusive education, and ensuring 95 per cent of school-age children with hearing, visual and intellectual disabilities are enrolled in compulsory education by 2020. 11 In 2017, the newly revised Regulations on the Education of Persons with Disabilities further encourages local governments to provide free pre-school and senior secondary education to students with disabilities facing financial difficulties, and gradually realize free senior secondary education for students with disabilities. 12 \nIn recent years, the education development for persons with disabilities has accelerated. In 2017, the enrolment ratio in compulsory education among children with visual, hearing and intellectual disabilities was over 90 per cent, with more than 50 per cent of students with disabilities attending regular classes in regular schools. 13 At present, universal access to compulsory education has been achieved in China, and universal access to senior secondary education will soon be achieved. However, the participation of children with disabilities in compulsory education still needs improvement, and their universal access to senior secondary education still has a long way to go. Challenges • While existing disability statistics play an important role in understanding the status and needs of persons with disabilities and supporting policy decisions relevant to the development of persons with disabilities, there is a lack of comprehensive, accurate and consistent information to ensure persons with disabilities can access preferential policies and welfare protection services that they are eligible for and in need of. 14 \n\n• There are still some children with disabilities in China, especially infants (age 0), who are not enrolled in any form of health insurance and have limited access to assistance and subsidies schemes. When considering the enormous cost of medical expenses for children with disabilities, the limited number of assistance and subsidies schemes is alarming. Additional efforts are needed to increase social assistance for children with disabilities in rural areas and young children with disabilities, including improving standards of medical assistance, increasing living subsidies for persons with disabilities facing financial difficulties and nursing subsidies for persons with serious disabilities. \n\n• Rehabilitation services for children with disabilities not only reduce the severity of the disability and prevent complications and onset of secondary disabilities, they also greatly compensate for physical and intellectual disabilities, contributing to the full inclusion and participation of children with disabilities in all aspects of life. However, the current system in China cannot fully meet the needs of all children with disabilities. The Government should continuously improve and perfect the rehabilitation assistance system for children with disabilities, establish a working mechanism for early prevention, early screening, early referral, early treatment and early rehabilitation, and enhance the coverage and standards of rehabilitation services, ensuring children with disabilities have universal access to basic rehabilitation services and grow to their full potential. Moreover, further development of a social model of disability, 15 exemplified by the CRPD, is required. \n\n• The participation rates of children with disabilities in compulsory education can be further improved. Children with varying types and severity of disabilities should have access to appropriate forms of education according to the specific needs based on their physical and psychological characteristics. Particularly, as a main goal, the government should strengthen the construction of a barrier-free environment in regular schools and actively promote inclusive education, ensuring children with disabilities are able to attend regular schools. Moreover, other options should be provided to meet children ’s needs depending on the nature and extent of their disabilities. Sometimes, special education schools can be a better option for some students. In other cases, the expansion of homebased educational support and distance education can be considered to ensure children with severe disabilities also enjoy access to education. \n• A certain degree of prejudice and discrimination against persons with disabilities still exist in society. In particular, caring for children with disabilities can be unduly demanding in contexts where infrastructure and access to services and support are inadequate or non-existent, which may result in the children being abandoned or sent to child welfare institutions. In the formulation of relevant laws, policies and plans, priority should be given to the rights and needs of children with disabilities. Specifically, the Government should optimize resource allocation in living assistance, medical care, rehabilitation, education and other areas, advocate the public to respect the right to survival, protection, development and participation of children with disabilities, address the physical, attitudinal, communication and social barriers faced by persons with disabilities, and prevent the marginalization of children with disabilities. \nFigure 11.1 and 11.2 \n\nAccording to the Second National Sample Survey on Disability conducted in 2006, China has an estimated 5.04 million children with disabilities who represent 1.6 per cent of all children in the country and 6.1 per cent of all persons with disabilities. Although the total population of the country has increased in the past decade, the total child population has been steadily decreasing. The Government has actively adopted measures including prevention of birth defects and child injuries to reduce the incidence of disability among children. However, as the risk factors for disability are on the rise, the current size and population of children with disabilities is similar to the 2006 National Sample Survey, with about 5 million children. \nPer cent 1 WHO, World Disability Report, 2011, http://www.who.int/disabilities/ world_report/2011/en/, accessed August 2018. Children with Disabilities \nData sources and references 2 The Second National Sample Survey on Disability of 2006 used the ‘ Criteria of Disabilities for the Second National Sample Survey on Disability ’, which were designed on the basis of the WHO ’s International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and the International Criteria of Functions, Disabilities and Health (ICFDH). Disabilities were accordingly divided into seven categories: visual, hearing, speech, physical, intellectual, mental and multiple. \n3 China Disabled Persons' Federation, ‘ Main Data Bulletin on the 2006 National Sample Survey on Disability (No. 1) ’, 7 April 2008, http://www.cdpf.org.cn/sjzx/ Cjrgk/200804/t20080407_387580.shtml, accessed August 2018. \n4 ZHANG Jun, ‘ Data Analysis Based on National Basic Population Database of Persons with Disabilities ’, Disability Research, no.3, 2013. \n5 The survey included information on the status and needs of basic services for persons with disabilities, including living assistance, social protection, rehabilitation services, assistive device services, access to education, employment support, care, poverty alleviation, housing security, barrier-free conversion, and rights protection. \n6 LING Kang, et al., Report on the Development for Persons with Disabilities in China 2006-2015, 2017, pp. 70. \n7 The most common forms of social assistance include dibao, as well as special assistance for education, natural disasters and other areas. \n8 Welfare subsidies include living subsidies for persons with disabilities facing financial difficulties and nursing subsidies for persons with serious disabilities, as well as disability allowance, transportation and communication subsidies, and other forms of welfare subsidies implemented in some areas. \n15 The social model of disability contrasts with what is called the medical model of disability. The social model sees ‘ disability ’ as the result of the interaction between people living with impairments and an environment filled with physical, attitudinal, communication and social barriers. It therefore carries the implication that the physical, attitudinal, communication and social environment must change to enable people living with impairments to participate in society on an equal basis with others. The social model of disability is now the internationally recognised way to view and address ‘ disability ’. The CRPD marks the official paradigm shift in attitudes towards people with disability and approaches to disability concerns. (People with Disability Australia, https://pwd.org.au/resources/social-model-of-disability/, accessed September 2018) \n16 Visual disability refers to a low vision of both eyes caused by various reasons that cannot be corrected, or the failure or constriction of vision that affects the daily life and social participation of the person. Visual disability includes both blindness and poor sight. \nHearing disability refers to the different extents of permanent hearing impairment in the ears caused by various reasons, so as to prevent the person from hearing or hearing clearly ambient sounds or speech sounds around him/her and affect the daily life and social participation of the person. \nSpeech disability refers to the speech impairment of different extents caused by various reasons, which is not cured after treatment of more than one year, or persists for over two years without treatment, so as to prevent or make it difficult for the person to conduct regular conversations and affect the daily life and social participation of the person. It includes aphasia, motor dysarthria, deformity dysarthria, articulation impediment, delayed speech development of children, speech impairment caused by hearing impairment, and stammering/stuttering. A person with speech impairment below three years old will not be considered as having a speech disability. \nPhysical disability refers to the loss of the physical motor functions and limited mobility or social participation to different extents caused by missing and injured limbs, paralysis and deformity of the torso due to structural and functional damage in the motor system of the person. It includes: (1) Missing and deformed upper and lower limbs and functional disorder of the upper and lower limbs due to injury, illness or abnormal development of the limbs, (I) Deformity or functional disorder of spinal cord due to injury, illness or abnormal development of the spinal cord, (III) Functional disorder of the torso or limbs caused by injury, illness or abnormal development of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Intellectual disability is markedly lower intellect than that of the general population and may be accompanied by a behavioural adaptability disorder. Such disability is caused by structural and functional disorders of the nervous system that limit one's mobility and social participation and requires an environment that simultaneously provides pervasive, extensive, limited or intermittent support. Intellectual disability includes retardation caused by different factors during intellectual development (before 18 years old) or damage/ deterioration caused by different factors after intellectual maturity. \nMental disability refers to the mental disorder that has lasted more than one year and has not been cured due to cognitive, emotional and behavioural disorders that affect the daily life and social participation of the person. \nMultiple disabilities refer to a person having two or more disabilities, including visual disability, hearing disability, speech disability, physical disability, intellectual disability and mental disability. \n(General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine of the People's Republic of China, Standardization Administration of the People's Republic of China, Classification and Grading Criteria of Disabilit, National Standard GB/T 26341-2010, http://www.cdpf.org.cn/ywzz/iviyb/jy 254/iyzcfg/201703/ P020170314345928864808.pdf, 2011) \n17 China Disabled Persons' Federation, '2017 Statistical Communiqué on the Development for Persons with Disabilities in China', 26 April 2018, http://www.cdpf.org.cn/zcwi/zxwj/201804/120180426 625574.shtml, accessed August 2018.

Methods Data were gathered from the Global Burden of Disease study. The prevalence \nand years lived with disability (YLDs) of intellectual disability among Chinese children and adolescents were compared with the global average by gender, age group, and severity of disability in 2019. Joinpoint regression model was used to analyze the trends in the prevalence and YLDs of intellectual disability among Chinese children and adolescents from 1990 to 2019. Results The prevalence and YLDs of intellectual disability among Chinese children and adolescents in 2019 were 1 522.65 per 100 000 (95%UI: 1 228.62 per 100 000-1 817.55 per 100 000) and 109.81 per 100 000 (95%UI: 72.15 per 100 000-158.09 per 100 000), respectively, which were lower than the global average. The prevalence and YLDs of severe intellectual disability in China were slightly higher than ·监测· \nthe global average. The average annual percent changes in the prevalence and YLDs of intellectual disability among Chinese children and adolescents were -0.23% (95%CI: -0.26%--0.21%, P<0.001) and 0.74% (95%CI: 0.66%-0.81%, P<0.001) from 1990 to 2019, respectively. The prevalence and YLDs of severe intellectual disability showed continuously increasing trends over the past 30 years. Conclusions The disease burden of intellectual disability among Chinese children and adolescents was lower than the global average in 2019, but severe intellectual disability was higher than the global average. The prevalence of intellectual disability among Chinese children and adolescents showed an overall decrease, while YLDs showed an increasing trend from 1990 to 2019. \n【 Key words 】 Intellectual

。智力残疾是一种严重的精神残疾，影响个体的沟通、社交、运动、自我照顾及管理等多方面功能，严重降低个体家庭、学校生活及工作的质量［ 2 ］ 。相比于同龄正常儿童，智力残疾儿童有更大的风险伴发生理疾病（如哮喘、腹泻）和心理疾病（如焦虑症、多动症） ，给家庭和社会带来［ 3-4 ］ 沉重负担。据估计， 2017年全球每10万儿童青少年中有3 207人患有智力残疾［ 5 ］ ，智力残疾已成为重大的公共卫生问题。中国智力残疾问题同样不容小视。 2006年第二次全国残疾人抽样调查结果显示，中国智力残疾患病率为7.5 ‰ ，占全部调查残疾的11.9% ［ 6 ］ 。本研究基于最新的全球疾病负担（ Global Burden of Disease ， GBD ）研究数据，分析中国0~19岁儿童青少年智力残疾流行现状及其1990-2019年疾病负担的长期变化趋势。

GBD研究中的智力残疾为发育性智力残疾。参照美国智力与发展障碍协会（ American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities ， AAIDD ）标准， GBD研究中将智力残疾定义为发生在18岁之前的智力明显低于同龄儿童平均水平的状态，并且依据智商（ intelligence quotient ， IQ ）测试得分将智力残疾分为5个等级：临界性智力残疾（IQ为70~85 ） 、轻度智力残疾（ IQ为50~69 ） 、中度智力残疾（IQ为35~49 ） 、重度智力残疾（ IQ为20~34 ） 、极重度智力残疾（IQ为0~19 ） ［ 10 ］ 。将0~19岁儿童青少年分为4个年龄组： 0~ 、 5~ 、 10~ 、 15~19岁。 GBD研究使用贝叶斯元回归工具DisMod-MR 2.1估计智力残疾患病率。使用患病率乘以相应的残疾权重计算智力残疾的模型，以智力残疾患病率（ /10万）或YLDs （人年/10万）为因变量，年份为自变量，采用Monte Carlo置换检验分析有统计学意义的连接点个数，此时的模型即筛选出的最优拟合模型。最优模型中连接点的位置即患病率长期变化趋势中的转折点。 Joinpoint回归模型的主要结果指标是年度变化百分比（ annual percent change ， APC ）和平均年度变化百分比（ average annual percent change ，AAPC ）及其95%CI 。APC即在各分段函数上因变量平均每年变化的百分比，反映各时间区间指标的变化趋势。 AAPC则是因变量在全局的平均变化趋势。上述分析使用美国国立癌症研究所肿瘤控制与人口科学部开发的Joinpoint 4.8.0软件完成。 \nYLDs ［ 7 ］ 。

，中度智力残疾患病率1990-1997年下降， 1997年之后呈现持续上升趋势。见图2 。 4.智力残疾YLDs变化趋势： Joinpoint回归模型结果显示， 1990-2019年中国儿童青少年智力残P<0.001 ） ，即1990-2019年30年间中国每10万儿疾YLDs的AAPC为0.74% （ 95%CI ： 0.66%~0.81% ，童青少年智力残疾的YLDs平均每年上升0.74%

，中度智力残疾的YLDs在1990-1997年下降， 1997年之后呈现持续上升趋势。见图3 。 讨论2021年国务院发布的《中国儿童发展纲要（ 2021-2030年） 》中提出“残疾儿童生存、发展和安全权益得到有效保障”的目标以及“建立残疾报告和信息共享制度”的策略措施［ 12 ］ ，表明国家和政府对残疾儿童的健康和发展日益重视。作为儿童主要残疾类型之一的智力残疾不仅对儿童自身的健康造成重大影响，而且给监护者带来极大的精神压力［ 2 ， 13 ］ 。智力残疾的负担高于视力残疾和听力残疾，因为视力和听力残疾可以通过眼镜和助听器等器具得到一定程度的矫正，而智力残疾尚无有效的矫正手段。同时，智力残疾儿童受到的社会歧视较为严重，相应的支持性服务不足［ 10 ］ 。因此，研究儿童青少年智力残疾疾病负担的流行状况及变化趋势具有重要的公共卫生和社会意义。本研究基于GBD数据发现1990-2019年中国儿童青少年智力残疾患病率整体呈现下降趋势，但重度智力残疾患病率却呈现持续上升趋势。智力残疾的YLDs在这30年间整体呈现上升趋势，其中重度智力残疾YLDs呈现持续上升趋势。2019年中国儿童青少年智力残疾的患病率和YLDs均低于全球平均水平，但重度智力残疾的患病率和YLDs则略高于全球平均水平。 本研究发现近30年中国儿童青少年智力残疾患病率整体呈现下降趋势，这可能与中国社会经济的飞速发展、医疗技术和妇幼保健水平的进步有关。研究表明，发育障碍，如胎儿和新生儿窒息、早产、过期产、低出生体重、发育异常等，是智力残疾发生的非遗传性因素［ 14 ］ ，而围产保健水平的提高可以降低发育障碍的发生。但是，美国的一项研究显示， 2009-2016年美国儿童青少年智力残疾患病率上升［ 15 ］ 。这提示我们智力残疾患病率的变化受到多种复杂因素的共同影响，未来应当深入分析不同国家和地区儿童智力残疾发病率和患病率的变化能出现患病率随年龄升高的现象。因此对于智力残疾患病率的年龄分布有待进一步研究。 虽然中国儿童青少年智力残疾的患病率低于全球平均水平，但考虑到中国巨大的人口基数以及智力残疾给儿童及家庭造成的巨大负担，应采取积极的预防及干预措施。由于智力残疾尚无治愈方法，最重要的措施是一级预防和干预，保障妇女在孕前及孕早期科学合理的膳食营养，避免环境有害因素的暴露；儿童早期保证充足营养，避免有害物质暴露（如铅暴露） ［ 10 ， 19-20 ］ 。二级预防则是在大脑发育敏感期进行智力残疾的早期筛查和干预［ 10 ］ 。对本研究结果显示， 1990-2019年中国儿童青少年智力残疾患病率和YLDs均明显低于全球平均水平，与既往在5岁以下儿童中的研究结果一致［ 10 ］ 。 Olusanya等［ 5 ］基于GBD2017数据的研究表明，东亚、东南亚地区儿童青少年智力残疾的患病率与北美地区接近。这可能与产前筛查的逐步普及使得患有唐氏综合征等出生缺陷的胎儿出生率大幅下降有关［ 17 ］ 。但本研究结果还显示， 2019年中国儿趋势，从而探索变化趋势背后的原因。此外，虽然患病率在这30年间呈现下降趋势，但YLDs则呈现上升趋势。这可能是由于医疗技术的进步和社会的发展延长了智力残疾患者的寿命［ 16 ］ ，同时意味着患者残疾状态持续时间的延长。在延长残疾人群生命长度的同时，如何提高他们的生命质量，是残疾人扶助中应当重点思考的问题，尤其是针对发生在生命早期的智力残疾。本研究还发现，在智力残疾患病率整体下降的同时，重度智力残疾患病率却持续上升。重度智力残疾对患者及家庭造成的负担要甚于轻、中度智力残疾，这提示应当注重儿童智力残疾的早期筛查，减少和避免残疾程度的加重。 \n于已确诊的智力残疾儿童，延缓和阻止其继续发展，通过康复服务提高其生活质量。 本研究的优势在于利用全国代表性的二手数据分析了中国儿童青少年30年长时间跨度的智力残疾疾病负担变化趋势，并与2019年全球智力残疾患病率及YLDs进行比较。本研究存在局限性。第一， GBD研究中智力残疾在IQ界值及严重程度分类上与AAIDD标准有所不同［ 1 ， 21 ］ ，难以与同类研究的智力残疾患病率进行横向比较；第二，因数据的局限，未分析中国儿童青少年智力残疾疾病负担的城乡差异；第三，尽管GBD研究采用了统一标准的数据处理和建模方法，但由于中国智力残疾研究相关的原始数据有限，疾病负担的估计可能存在偏倚［ 7 ］ 。 \nYLDs综呈上现所上述升，趋本势研。2019究发现年1990-2019中国儿童年青中少国年儿智童力青少年智力残疾患病率整体呈现下降趋势，但残疾疾病负担低于全球平均水平，但重度智力残疾疾病负担高于全球平均水平。因此，在低生育率的背景下，政府应当尤其重视预防儿童青少年智力残童青少年重度智力残疾患病率和YLDs均略高于全球平均水平。总智力残疾患病率与重度智力残疾患病率与全球水平对比的差异提示，应重点关注重度智力残疾的预防及干预。本研究发现男生智力残疾患病率高于女生，与既往研究结论一致［ 2 ， 10 ］ 。本研究还发现低年龄组儿童智力残疾患病率高于高年龄组，与Olusanya等［ 5 ］的研究结果一致，但McGuire等［ 15 ］的研究则显示儿童青少年群体中年龄越大智力残疾患病率越高。 5岁之前是儿童神经发育的快速增长时期，也是大脑发育对外界刺激和营养缺乏最敏感的时期［ 18 ］ ，因此年龄越小的儿童智\n力残疾的发生风险越高。但由于年龄累积效应，可疾的发生。

        "text": "UNPRPD Situational Analysis in DRC 1 SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE RIGHTS OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES IN \nCHINA COUNTRY REPORT September 2023 Disclaimer The data and information presented in the report are based on the situational analyses conducted at the country level. Methodology for data collection included a desk review of relevant literature, key informant interviews and focus groups, and consultative workshops with key stakeholders. The UNPRPD has not edited the report or verified the findings for accuracy. This report does not necessarily reflect the position of the UNPRPD MPTF. Table of Contents \nAcronyms and Abbreviations \nExecutive Summary 2023 marks the 15 th year since China has ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2008. The landscape of disability inclusion in China has been undergoing deep transformation. This Situational Analysis provides an overview of the five preconditions for disability inclusion, as defined by the United Nations Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNPRPD) — equality and non-discrimination, inclusive service delivery, accessibility, CRPD compliant budgeting, and accountability and governance; and three cross-cutting issues including participation, inequalities, and gender. For each area of inquiry, the analysis follows the research questions provided by the UNPRPD, in identifying the gaps and opportunities to inform future development programs. The analysis is primarily based on secondary literature review, supplemented with consultations, carried out between March 2023 and June 2023. \nEquality and Non-Discrimination: China has more than 80 laws and 50 administrative regulations directly related to the interests of persons with disabilities, and regularly updated its national strategy for disability since 1991. Translating these commitments into better inclusion requires efforts to better align disabilityrelated policies and laws with the social model of disability, meaningfully engage OPDs independent from the state in decision making, and fully implement accessibility, reasonable accommodations, and antidiscrimination provisions. Culturally, the charity or medical model of disability remains dominant in public attitudes. \nAccessibility: China has issued more than 450 regulations, rules and normative documents on accessibility implementation and management. In recent years, campaigns are carried out to improve access to information. A further welcoming development is the new Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, passed on June 28, 2023. The effects of these policies depend on strong enforcement, sufficient remedies, and the meaningful engagement of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessibility tools and rules, with considerations of diverse needs among marginalized communities, such as deaf people/persons with hearing impairments, persons with intellectual disabilities, and persons with psychosocial disabilities. \nInclusive Service Delivery: Among 85 million officially estimated persons with disabilities, 38 million (44.7%) hold a disability certificate as of 2021. The task for service provision is daunting given the huge and diverse demands, and China has reached impressive coverage of services, especially in social protection and rehabilitation. To better align with the CRPD, the next step is to shift the focus from welfare provision to social inclusion, from special needs to inclusive services. This would require better rights awareness, accessibility, and reasonable accommodations in mainstream services, such as health, education, and employment; stronger support for caregiving instead of demanding family responsibilities; and more equitable allocation of resources for marginalized communities, such as persons with disabilities in rural areas, persons with severe or multiple disabilities, women with disabilities, and persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: According to the Ministry of Finance, in 2021, the national public budget expenditure on disability affairs was CNY 70.6 billion, roughly 0.287% of the total national general public budget expenditure. Majority of the disability budget (43.3%) was spent on living and care subsidies. Inclusive services such as inclusive education and employment, as championed by the CRPD, need stronger financial support. \nAccountability and governance: The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recommends an independent mechanism appointed to monitor the implementation of the CRPD. The CDPF regularly collects data from disability certificate holders and publishes annual updates in its key mandates, yet the data is not specifically aligned with the definition of disability or priority areas of the CRPD or SDGs. Data disaggregated by disability in mainstream statistical efforts need enhancement. Cross-cutting issues: The CDPF and its networks, ministries, OPDs, parent groups, CSOs, development partners, academia, and private sector form a vibrant sector working on the issue of disability in China. The challenge is to strengthen meaningful coordination within the government, and between OPDs and different stakeholders, especially when the social model of disability is not yet the consensus, resulting in scattered resources devoted to divergent, sometimes opposing, directions. Women with disabilities account for 49.33% of the total population with disabilities. Women face continued barriers in equal opportunities to education and employment, sexual and reproductive health, and marriage and social life. Further, voices of persons with disabilities and their representative groups, remain marginalized in the decision making, policy making, and humanitarian and development programming about disability. Among them, persons with disabilities in rural areas, persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities, and women with disabilities, are most disadvantaged. \nThis Situational Analysis reaffirms the importance of close partnerships between stakeholders, and the leadership of OPDs in making decisions about disability towards inclusion. Key recommendations of the report include: building meaningful mechanisms to enhance OPD participation that combines OPDs ’ expertise and other stakeholders ’ access to policy making; strengthening partnerships with specific government departments beyond its disabled persons ’ federations (DPFs) 1 , especially at local levels; and leveraging ongoing policy windows in accessibility, employment, and health. Background \nPurpose of analysis The UN Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (PRPD) is dedicated to the implementation of the CRPD, by bringing together different UN entities, governments, persons with disabilities and civil society for the purpose of joint programming and partnerships. To better support countries, the PRPD believes it is necessary to understand what the main bottlenecks and priorities are in each country in relation to the fulfilment of the CRPD. This Situational Analysis was developed as a requirement of the inception phase of the fourth call for proposals of the UNPRPD Multi-Partner Trust Fund (UNPRPD MPTF). Key objectives of the 4 th call include advancing CRPD implementation at country level by focusing on the preconditions for disability inclusion across sectors, and improving the implementation of disability inclusive SDGs at the country level. The main goal of the situational analysis is to inform the design of future cross-sector PRPD programs in China, with the report serving as a baseline. The analysis also aims to build working relationships between UN entities, government, OPDs, other civil society organizations, private sector and academia, as a basis for future co-design of programs; to strengthen the capacity of above stakeholders to include and address the rights of persons with disabilities more effectively; and to inspire disability inclusion adjustments in ongoing UN programs and processes. Introduction to disability in China Officially, China is home to 85 million persons with disabilities, roughly 6% of the total population. The most recent national survey on disability (2006) found that 17.8% of households in China had family members with disabilities. 75.04% of persons with disabilities resided in rural areas, 53.24% were above 60 years old, and 51.55% were men. 2 China ’s Law on the Protection of Disabled Persons (LPPD) defines a person with disabilities as “ one who has abnormalities of loss of a certain organ or function, psychologically or physiologically, or in anatomical structure and has lost wholly or in part the ability to perform an activity in the way considered normal. ” Based on this definition, six categories of disability are certified, including visual disabilities, hearing disabilities, physical disabilities, speech disabilities, intellectual disabilities, and psychiatric disabilities, with four grades under each category. By 2021, 38 million persons with disabilities held a disability certificate, among whom 22 million were men, and 30.1 million were registered as rural residents. 3 Among the disability certificate holders, 18.7% were illiterate, 40.3% received primary education, and 30.3% went to middle school. 4 \nThe China Disabled Persons Federation (CDPF), a semi-governmental mass organization with vice-ministry level status, was founded in 1988, marking significant national commitment to disability issues. 5 The CDPF ’s mission is to “ represent, serve, and manage ” persons with disabilities across China. 6 By 2018, a 4中国残疾人联合会. (2021).已办残疾证残疾人受教育程度. \ntotal of 42,000 disabled persons ’ federations (DPFs) had been set up at all administrative levels, 7 with about 90,000 full-time workers and 400,000 part-time staff members. 8 Shortly after the establishment of the CDPF, the LPPD, China first basic law for the rights protection of persons with disabilities was promulgated in 1990. Among the first countries to sign the CRPD, China ratified the CRPD in 2008. Under Article 35 of the CRPD, China has completed its first periodic report in 2012, and second and third combined in 2018. The latest review sessions of the State party reports by the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities concluded in 2022. 9 Approach \nGuiding principles Taking a rights-based approach rooted in the CRPD, this report follows the UNPRPD ’s framework of five preconditions for disability inclusion, namely, equality and non-discrimination, inclusive service delivery, accessibility, CRPD compliant budgeting, and accountability and governance; and three cross-cutting issues including participation, inequalities, and gender. \nThe research team follows the principle “ nothing about us without us ” in the design, implementation, and consultations of the situational analysis, ensuring the direct involvement of national and local organizations of persons with disabilities (OPDs), unofficial self-help groups of persons with disabilities, as well as individuals with disabilities. The core research team consists of members of a national OPD and an individual consultant in close coordination with the UNPRPD Taskforce in China, comprised of UNESCO, ILO, UNFPA, UN Women, and WHO. \nDespite time constraints, the research team strived to leverage the analysis as an opportunity to enhance relationships with and among stakeholders, bringing together government stakeholders, UNCT, and OPD leaders since the work plan design phase. Drafts of the report were sent to the UNCT, key government stakeholders, and OPDs for review, to ensure they are informed and involved in the analysis process. Methodology This report followed the research questions listed in the “ UN PRPD guidance for conducting a situational country analysis of the rights of persons with disabilities. ” The analysis took place from March 2023 to June 2023. Due to the condensed timeframe of the analysis and the richness of existing literature, the analysis is primarily based on desk review of secondary literature and data, supplemented with key informant interviews, focus group discussions, an OPD preparatory workshop, and a multi-stakeholder consultation. \nFor desk research, the analysis draws comprehensively from existing literature on the preconditions of inclusion in China, ranging from the CRPD reviews, issue-based UN publications, government documents, official database and publications of the CDPF, articles published by OPDs, media reports, as well as Chinese and English language academic research. \nConsultations for the analysis focused on questions under-addressed by existing literature. Depending on stakeholders ’ accessibility preferences and availability, a mixture of consultation methods were adopted. The research team consulted in total 70 informants through in-person/online interviews, email questionnaires, focus group discussions, meetings, and soliciting written feedback and evidence. Email questionnaires and interviews were conducted with 33 OPDs, among which 42% of are unregistered grassroots groups, located in 18 different cities, working on promoting the rights of persons with physical, visual, intellectual, psychosocial, hearing, or multiple impairments, people with rare diseases, gender, and cross-disability issues. The team also interviewed and/or organized focus group discussions with 4 civil society organizations, and 5 government institutions, including the Education and Employment Department, Rights Protection Department, and Organizational and Liaison Department of the China Disabled Persons ’ Federation. Further, the research team reached out to 22 experts with domain-specific questions through written or online interviews, including scholars, lawyers, and UN agencies, among whom 6 are persons with disabilities. The draft report went through comprehensive reviews by 3 external experts, representing the perspectives of OPDs, policy makers, and development partners, with specializations in law, education, and OPD development. List of consulted stakeholders is not provided for protection of anonymity. \nIn addition, the report incorporated data generated at four workshops. 30 stakeholders offered their perspectives in the induction trainings on 15-18 November 2022, and 8-9 December 2022. 34 OPD representatives from 28 organizations joined the OPD preparatory workshop on 8 May 2023, among whom 11 are persons with disabilities. On 9 May 2023, 74 stakeholders from 61 organizations attended the multi-stakeholder workshop, 19 of whom are persons with disabilities, representing OPDs, government, CSOs, academia, private sector, and development partners. Scope and limitations The Situational Analysis is a combination of consolidating existing data and consulting diverse opinions. It is therefore not an original research based on primary sources or raw data collection. The Situational Analysis is designed to inform future program design on disability inclusion under the framework of UNPRPD, not an expert opinion by the United Nations. \nThe analysis has revealed significant gaps in data availability, which means the data currently available is insufficient to answer the full range of analytical questions and topics covered in the UNPRPD framework. Some questions are insufficiently addressed due to the complexity and scale of the issue, unavailability of reliable data, or potential risks for stakeholders. A few questions are listed as suggestions for more comprehensive research in the future. \nAmong existing data, consistency in the definition of disability is not guaranteed. Government data tend to focus on registered organizations, and disability certificate holders which follows an impairment-based, biomedical definition of disability. Other studies may use informal channels to reach persons with disabilities and unregistered groups. \nIn light of the limited scope of the report, the analysis does not include all the information available for each focus area. It prioritizes addressing the questions listed in the UNPRPD Situational Analysis Guideline and identifying gaps and opportunities for future collaboration among multiple stakeholders. Conducted between March and June 2023, the analysis may not reflect the latest developments of this fast-changing field. \nThe majority of OPDs consulted for the report are urban, registered organizations, representing the interests of people with physical or visual impairments, cross disabilities, or parent groups of people with intellectual disabilities, including organizations led by women with disabilities; but less so for deaf organizations, self-advocates with intellectual disabilities or psychosocial disabilities. Further, voices of more marginalized persons with disabilities, such as those living in rural areas, or with multiple/severe disabilities, are largely reflected through secondary literature and data. Like other studies, those who were able to respond to our consultation are tip of the iceberg that are already active and expressive, but the vast majority of the most marginalized communities remain difficult to reach and their voices remain unheard. Findings \n1. Stakeholder and coordination analysis \n1.1 Government Lead ministries in ensuring the rights of persons with disabilities include the Ministry of Civil Affairs, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and the National Health Commission, which, together with the China Disabled Persons ’ Federation, form the core of the State Council Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work. Other important government stakeholders include National Bureau of Statistics, the Supreme People ’s Court, and the Supreme People ’s Procuratorate. As with SDGs, in 2016, China established an inter-ministerial coordination mechanism involving 45 government departments for SDG implementation, assigning the 17 goals and 169 targets to different departments according to their administrative responsibilities. 10 \nThe China Disabled Persons ’ Federation (CDPF) functions as the de facto whole-of-government disability focal point. It is a semi-governmental umbrella mass organization funded by the Chinese government to represent, serve, and supervise disability related affairs. Established in 1988, it now has a nationwide network of local branches across China, with about 90,000 full-time workers and 400,000 part-time staff members. 11 By 2018, a total of 42,000 disabled persons ’ federations (DPFs) had been set up across the nation. 12 \nThe Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work at all levels consist of ministry-specific disability focal points within government. At the State Council level, it is formed by focal points from 34 ministries, departments and organizations to coordinate the formulation and implementation of policies and programs in relation to persons with disabilities and address major disability-related issues. 13 The Committee is also responsible for coordinating major United Nations activities regarding disability affairs in China, including promoting the implementation of the CRPD. 14 The Committee ’s Secretariat is held by the CDPF ’s General Office. 15 At the local levels, the working committees mirror the same structure, usually chaired by the deputy head of the same level government, with focal points from various departments. 16 \nOfficial Associations: Under the supervision of the CDPF, there are five specialized national associations representing the interests of people with various types of disabilities: the China Association of the Blind, the China Association of the Deaf, the China Association of Persons with Physical Disabilities, the China Association of Persons with Intellectual Disability and their Relatives, the China Association of Persons with Psychiatric Disability and their Relatives. The five associations and its local branches operate as internal parts of the CDPF and its branches. 17 By 2018, there were a total of 16,000 branches of these 13 Ibid. \nassociations at provincial, municipal, and county levels. 18 In recent years, reform efforts have been made to register special associations as separate legal entities from the DPFs to enhance the professionalization of the associations. 19 Other state-affiliated mass organizations also play a role in domain-specific disability issues, such as All China Women ’s Federation, China Internet Society, and China Family Planning Association. 1.2 Disability Movement (OPDs) Based on the UNPRPD guidance, this report defines organizations of persons with disabilities (OPDs) as follows: “ Organizations of persons with disabilities are led, directed and governed by persons with disabilities. A clear majority of their membership should be recruited among persons with disabilities themselves. ” 20 According to this definition, organizations “ that work on disability inclusion are considered organizations ‘ for ’ persons with disabilities ” and do not count as OPDs. \nThe actual number of OPDs in China is unavailable and should be addressed by future research. Current estimations range from roughly 150 OPDs across China, 21 to only a handful of OPDs with continuous programs and staff, according to OPD informants consulted. Representative OPDs include, but are not limited to: 22 \nCross-disability OPDs: Cross-disability OPDs are among the most active at the national level. They pursue a diverse range of advocacy and service goals, including independent living, awareness raising of the CRPD, diverse employment (e.g. One Plus One Disability Group); public education on disability and gender equality (e.g. Beijing Enable Sister Center); inclusive education, and accessibility (e.g. Minority Voices). \nImpairment-based OPDs: In addition to cross-disability OPDs, many organizations serving communities of people with specific kinds of impairments are also active. These include organizations by and for people with physical impairments (e.g. Beijing New Start Foundation), deaf and/or people with hearing impairments (e.g. ProSigner, Know Deaf), people with visual impairments (e.g. Golden Cane 23 ), people with rare diseases (e.g. Illness Challenge Foundation), people with cerebral palsy (e.g. Angel House), and people on the autism spectrum (e.g. Mutual Support for Asperger's). \nOPDs in China tend to concentrate in urban areas, leaving a significant gap in smaller cities and rural areas. Many OPDs take the form of unregistered, online virtual groups, or small self-help groups, and very few have more than five full-time staff. Among existing OPDs, persons with intellectual disabilities, people with psychosocial disabilities, elderly people with disabilities, persons with disabilities living in rural areas, people with multiple impairments, and LGBTI persons with disabilities are underrepresented. For persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities, self-advocacy groups are still rare. Most of their representative groups are led by parents. 1.3 Parent Organizations It is debatable whether parent groups count as OPDs. In China, many parent groups self-identify as OPDs. Unlike other CSOs, they face similar barriers as OPDs, and are currently the main advocates for persons with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities. One Foundation, through their parent support programs, estimated that there were 162 parent organizations across China, mostly concentrated in capitals and first-tier cities. 24 In 2014, 17 parent groups and organizations across China formed a voluntary national network called Inclusion China, and by 2017 the network expanded to 69 members. 25 Another major network, Shenzhen Autism Society, for instance, has 116 member organizations as of 2023. 26 Total account of parent groups in China needs further research. 1.4 Service providing organisations (CSOs and INGOs) Government-procured service providers: Across China, many registered CSOs provide medical or vocational rehabilitation, day care, social work, assistive technology, and other services for persons with disabilities in local communities. As of June 2020, China had more than 7,800 officially registered social organizations that provides service and support in the disability field. 27 OPD informants of this report note that most of these CSOs for persons with disabilities do not have staff with disabilities. \nPhilanthropic Foundations: According to a recent OPD report, 2,363 philanthropic foundations had disability-related components in their programs, 27.59% of the total number of foundations in China. Between 2016 and 2020, funding for disability programs in disability-related foundations increased from CNY 5.58 billion to CNY 11.5 billion. Most of these foundations concentrate in East and Southwest China, with a focus on persons with physical disabilities, prioritizing rehabilitation and assistive technology. 28 International NGOs (INGOs): INGOs used to play an active role in supporting disability programs in China, providing funding, capacity building, and technical assistance for domestic CSOs/OPDs. The 2016 Law on Administration of Activities of Overseas Nongovernmental Organisations significantly increased the threshold and administrative costs for INGOs to operate in China. Currently, a handful INGOs are still working on disability issues in China, including Humanity & Inclusion (formerly known as Handicap International), which works on emergency relief, access to education and employment, sexual and reproductive health, gender-based violence against women and girls with disabilities, and social inclusion; Save the Children, which focuses on inclusive education for children with disabilities; as well as the Asia Foundation, Special Olympics East Asia, Kadoorie Charitable Foundation, Marie Stopes International, and the Ford Foundation. \nCSO/INGO engagement with OPDs varies according to their funding source, mandate, and awareness of the social model of disability. A handful of CSOs with exposure to the CRPD and INGOs tend to consciously engage OPDs, yet consultation shows that grassroots OPDs are largely disconnected from most CSOs in China. To date, there is no single civil society platform for SDG implementation, nor are OPDs actively engaged in policy platforms for SDG (see Section 8.1). 1.5 International Cooperation (UN Agencies, Donors) UNPRPD China Programme was implemented from 2014 to 2020. As a result of the Programme, the UN Country Team in China formed and institutionalized the UN Theme Group on Disability (UNTGD), a comprehensive, multi-stakeholder platform composing of over 100 key stakeholders for open dialogue and advocacy on the needs and rights of persons with disabilities in China. The UNTGD aims to consolidate the efforts and foster consultation and collaboration of its members including UN agencies and external disability stakeholders, in supporting the government in fulfilling its commitments to the CRPD and in achieving national goals on ensuring the equal rights of persons with disabilities. \nThe UNTGD is positioned to support the effective implementation of UN ’s collective commitments and actions in the new UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF), and to strengthen the UN ’s accountability towards disability inclusion in response to the Disability Inclusion Scorecard. The UNRCO and all UN agencies have respectively assigned a disability focal point as UNTGD member. The following agencies are especially engaging in advancing the rights of persons with disabilities with specific focuses relevant to their respective mandates: \n• UNESCO: inclusive education, information accessibility, promotion of disability inclusion through and in media and culture, media and information as well as digital literacy \n\n• UNICEF: inclusive education, accessible and child-friendly environment, social protection for children with disabilities, inclusive child welfare and protection services, public awareness raising and advocacy on disability inclusion. \n\n• UNFPA: strengthen universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) and GBV information and services, and advocate disability data generation \n\n• UNDP: access to justice for persons with disabilities \n\n• ILO: employment and decent work for persons with disabilities \n\n• UN Women: Research on gender gaps between men with disabilities and women with disabilities and support the advocacy of the rights of women and girls with disabilities \nNo other UN agencies ’ joint programs supporting legislative reforms, policy development or other relevant national programs that are important for persons with disabilities are available. The knowledge and understanding of UN agencies staff on disability inclusive programming have been gradually enhanced in recent years, especially among the staff members from the agencies that are closely involved in the capacity building activities and joint programmes and activities on disability inclusion. Key trainings include: a half-day meeting and discussion on disability equality for UN staff held on 1 August 2018, participated by 18 UN colleagues from 10 UN agencies; a Disability Equality Training workshop for UNCT held in 2019 to strengthen the UNCT ’s capacity to ensure a human rights-based approach to disability is reflected in their work at all times, participated by 16 representatives from six UN agencies; a knowledge sharing session at the regular meeting of the UN Communications Group in China on media communications for promoting disability equality in China held in 2021, participated by communication officers from 20 UN agencies; and the six-day Induction workshop held under the UNPRPD 4th Funding Call Inception Phase in November-December 2022, participated by six colleagues representing 5 UN agencies, including UNESCO, ILO, UNFPA, WHO, UN Women and FAO. \nThe situation and rights of persons with disabilities is incorporated into the Common Country Analysis, UNSDCF and Joint Work Plans in full consultation with the UNTGD. As a result, the UNSDCF 2021-2025 has integrated disability inclusion by setting the commitment to “ leaving no one behind ” as one of its guiding principles and explicitly identifying persons with disabilities as one o f the groups more at risk of being left behind in China. Persons with disability are particularly referenced in parts related to rehabilitation services, full social inclusion, development, and legitimate rights and interests. Besides, UNSDCF also specifically stipulates that the participation of CDPF in the review and implementation of the UNSDCF will be made at the level of the Results Groups. \nSpecifically, under the UNSDCF Strategic Priority 1 “ People and Prosperity: Achieving innovation-driven, coordinated and shared development ”, Outcome 2 reads, “ People ’s lives in China are improved further as headways is made in ensuring access to childcare, education, healthcare services, elderly care, housing, and social assistance, and more people in China, including left-behind groups, benefit from equitable and high quality public services and social protection systems as well as accelerated efforts to reduced gender inequality and other forms of social inequality throughout the life-course. ” \nThe UN makes an effort to engage persons with disabilities and their representative organizations closely across ongoing programs at country level. One attempt was to make the UN premises more accessible. An assessment on the accessibility of the physical environment and services of all UN premises in China has been completed with support of the Accessibility Development Institute of Tsinghua University in 2021, with detailed recommendations provided for improvement. \nUNTGD provides a platform for international development partners to engage with OPDs. Currently, a few bilateral and multilateral donors such as the European Commission and British Council still have programs on disability. However, consultations show that international cooperation is increasingly scrutinized by authorities, and OPDs and local stakeholders are cautious about such engagement. \n1.6 Other Key Stakeholders (Academic, Private sector): Academic institutions or think tanks play an important role in the sector, due to their access to policy making channels. However, not all academics are aligned with the CRPD. OPDs are concerned that some academic institutions regard disability as an object of research but do not meaningfully engage OPDs, displacing rather than amplifying the voices of persons with disabilities. \nPrivate sector is increasingly active in disability inclusion, due to shifting funding structure for OPDs/CSOs, domestic policy incentives for disability-inclusive employment and services, and global corporate cultural change towards Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), and corporate social responsibility (CSR). A few social enterprises have been active in engaging the private sector. However, balancing the interests of business clients and the disability community is a challenge, which needs to involve different stakeholders, including government, disability advocates, and businesses themselves. A missed opportunity identified by informants is the lack of engagement with OPDs, reinforcing the fragmentation of limited resources of the field. Further, most businesses still lack the awareness of the social model of disability, taking a charity-based or tokenistic approach. 1.7 Key Stakeholder Coordination Mechanisms In China, most OPDs are unregistered, virtual groups rather than registered organizations with a physical presence, reachable through informal networks of key individuals within disability community. Administratively, the threshold for registration as a social organization with the Ministry of Civil Affairs is high. According to a 2015 survey of 110 OPDs in China, only 58% of OPDs are legally registered with bureaus of civil affairs. 29 OPD informants point out that registered OPDs also face strict administrative requirements. Financially, many OPDs ’ funding sources were impacted by the Law on Administration of Activities of Overseas Nongovernmental Organisations, adopted in 2016, which significantly restricted domestic NGOs and individuals from obtaining funding from overseas NGOs. 30 Main funding sources available now are the government, the general public, and the private sector. These funders tend to prefer more traditional approaches to disability such as the charity or medical model, thus disadvantaging OPDs promoting the social model of disability. OPDs consulted for this report, mostly grassroots, lack experience working with INGOs, the UN, or academic partners. Key OPD informants observe that compared to other civil society groups, OPDs in China tend to rely on individual leaders and face more challenges in professional development, due to systemic exclusion of persons with disabilities in social participation, such as quality education. \nWithin China ’s national development frameworks and human rights monitoring and reporting, disability is represented as a special issue, rather than mainstreamed as a cross-cutting issue across sectors. China ’s national human rights monitoring and reporting such as human rights white papers refer to disability as one thematic issue among “ vulnerable groups ” such as women, children, ethnic minority, and elderly people. Consultation shows that the CDPF and its local networks dominate the current coordination mechanism to facilitate disability-related actions across different sectors and levels of the government. 1.8 Stakeholder Capacity Gaps Within the government, the current coordination mechanism guarantees financial and human resources on disability across different levels of the government through the CDPF networks. This bureaucratic division of labor, however, tend to pigeon-hole disability as CDPF ’s responsibility and lacks the support from mainstream ministries. Expert informants point out that as a “ semi-governmental, semi-civil ” organization, CDPF does not have the same administrative power as the ministries, making certain coordination with other ministries difficult. \nCoordination mechanisms between government and OPDs are inconsistent. Formal mechanisms for stateendorsed CSOs/OPDs to coordinate with the government do exist, such as the Disabled People ’s Representative Congress. For independent OPDs, however, coordination with the government is limited. OPDs that have successfully engaged the government tend to leverage informal channels such as joint programs with DPFs or the special associations, working with key individuals within the government, or submitting policy proposals through elected National People ’s Congress (NPC) and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) representatives. Nevertheless, most OPDs lack access to these mechanisms. In the limited scope of consultations for this report, informants note that formal mechanisms of OPDs participation tend to be symbolic, and the power imbalance makes meaningful dialogue difficult. Meanwhile, results of informal mechanisms are highly contingent. For more detail, see Section 7.1. \nOPD informants critique that the framing of “ capacity gap ” is misleading, when persons with disabilities do not have equal access to social capital and resources as the government or other CSOs, nor do OPDs have the power to meaningfully participate. A common capacity gap identified by rights holders (OPDs), duty bearers (government) and development partners is resource mobilization. Consultations show that the lack of overall resources dedicated to disability inclusion, and the diverse range of needs of persons with different impairments has created competitions rather than collaboration among OPDs and other stakeholders. A deeper gap identified in consultation is the low awareness of the social model of disability, rendering government, OPDs, and other stakeholders devoting scattered resources to different, sometimes opposing, directions. 2. Equality and non-discrimination \n2.1 Legislative and policy context China has ratified the CRPD in 2008, without ratifying its Optional Protocol. Under Article 35 of the CRPD, China completed its first periodic report in 2012, and second and third combined in 2018. Review of the latest report concluded in September 2022. On 5 February 2022, China ratified the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled. Other international human rights treaties that China ratified include Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), Convention against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), and International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD). 31 Reporting for CEDAW and CRC typically include references to persons with disabilities. Officially, China has more than 80 laws and 50 administrative regulations directly related to the interests of persons with disabilities. 32 The main legislation stipulating the rights of persons with disabilities in China is the Law on the Protection of Disabled Persons (LPPD), first enacted in 1990 and amended in 2008 in anticipation of the CRPD ratification. Legal experts point out that significant gaps still exist between the 2008 LPPD and the CRPD, including, but not limited to, the lack of provisions of reasonable accommodation, equal recognition before law, and full inclusion of women and children with disabilities, and the law ’s prioritization of prevention and rehabilitation of disability based on medical definitions of disability. 33 A crucial gap lies in the difference in definitions of disability between the LPPD and CRPD, leading to different approaches to addressing disability-related issues. The LPPD (2008) defines a person with disabilities as “ one who has abnormalities of loss of a certain organ or function, psychologically or physiologically, or in anatomical structure and has lost wholly or in part the ability to perform an activity in the way considered normal. ” 34 \nIn addition to the LPPD, major legislations include the 2017 Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities, the 2017 Regulations on the Education of Persons with Disabilities, the Regulations on the Employment of the Disabled, and the 2012 Regulations on the Construction of Barrier-free Environments, 35 and the 2012 Mental Health Law. China ’s first Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments solicited public comments for drafts in 2022 and 2023, and was passed on June 28, 2023, which presents a key policy window for accessibility advocacy. \nChina does not have a general anti-discrimination framework or legislation, 36 although disability related laws are “ against disability-based discrimination ” in principle. The current laws and policies do not have a clear definition of disability-based discrimination, making it difficult for judicial determination of discrimination. 37 The provision of reasonable accommodation is not yet included in all relevant laws and policies, and lacks clear guidance on implementation and effective remedies. 38 As a step forward, some local regulations began explicitly referencing reasonable accommodations. 39 Major progress was made in the national college entrance examination (gaokao) system. Since 2014, there has been policy development for students with disabilities to apply for reasonable accommodations to take gaokao. Statistics show that, in 2017, 5626 students with disabilities applied for reasonable accommodation for gaokao. Advocates call for expanding such progress to more areas such as exams for public servants, high school entrance exams, and judicial exams. 40 \nChina has regularly updated its national strategy for disability since 1991, in the form of five-year development plans. By far, the State Council has issued eight five-year development plans for persons with disabilities, incorporated into the overall five-year plans for national economic and social development. Government at local levels shall make corresponding implementation plans and incorporate the implementation into government work evaluation. Annual monitoring, mid-term evaluation, concluding evaluation, third-party evaluation, and social satisfaction rate survey of the implementation of the five-year plans, are also stipulated. 41 The latest plan, the 14 th Five-year Plan on the Protection and Development of Persons with Disabilities (2021-2025), focuses on livelihood and employment, social protection, and basic public services. It sets the framework and indicators for implementation, although it is not specifically aligned with the CRPD or SDG plans and programs. \nA key legal harmonization effort, according to UN ESCAP, is “ the revision by China in 2008 of its 1990 law on the protection of persons with disabilities in an effort to incorporate the concepts and principles of the Convention into the legislation. This included a prohibition of disability discrimination, although it did not include definitions of disability or reasonable accommodation championed by the CRPD and did not explicitly state that denial of reasonable accommodation is disability discrimination. Subsequent ongoing reform efforts in China have since led to revision of the laws and regulations relating to education, transport, accessibility to the built environment and the mental health law in an effort to align them with the Convention. ” 42 2.2 Barriers to Equity The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities observed systemic barriers to the inclusion of persons with disabilities in China, including that 43 : \n• disability-related policies and laws do not fully align with the social model of disability; \n\n• OPDs independent from the state are not meaningfully included in policy-making; \n\n• anti-discrimination and reasonable accommodations are not legally guaranteed or fully implemented; \n\n• there are limited mechanisms in preventing violence, trafficking, forced marriage, neglect, or abandonment of women and children with disabilities; \n\n• substitute decision-making regime persists to deny or restricts adults with disabilities in their legal capacity to act; \n\n• lack of procedural accommodation, accessible information, and inaccessible buildings impedes disabled persons ’ access to justice; \n\n• discriminatory provisions in the LPPD allow for coercive institutionalization and treatment of persons with psychosocial disabilities; \n\n• accessibility regulations and standards are insufficiently enforced; \n\n• the state pressures on and censors rights-based advocacy; \n\n• segregated special education remains the norm and mainstream schools lack support regarding inclusive education; \n\n• the right to freely choose occupations and access to just and favourable conditions of work is lacking; \n\n• and legal restrictions to disabled persons ’ political participation still persists. \nAmong these barriers, consultations for this report identified the social prejudice and discrimination against persons with disabilities as the most fundamental. Debates between the “ welfare ” approach and the “ rights ” approach to disability remain among policy and law makers. Specific barriers in domains such as accessibility, education, and employment will be addressed in detail in Section 3 and Section 4. 3. Accessibility \n3.1 Legislative and policy context By 2017, China has issued 451 regulations, rules and normative documents on accessibility implementation and management. 44 The main regulation on accessibility is the Regulations on the Construction of Barrier-free Environments (2012), which stipulate that the construction and modification of roads, public buildings, public transport facilities, residential buildings and residential areas shall comply with the construction standards for barrier-free facilities. China also incorporated barrier-free construction into its national development plans, such as the Implementation Programme for Construction of Barrier-Free Environments during the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (2016 –2020), and the National Plan on New Urbanization (2014 –2020). National accessibility standards (GB 50763-2012) have also been adopted. Comprehensive data about the application of the technical standards are unavailable and should be addressed by future research. Accessibility is not yet mainstreamed into public procurement, according to government informants consulted. \nIn recent years, more attention has been paid to the accessibility of information and communications. In 2020, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and CDPF issued the Guiding Opinions on Promoting Information Accessibility, focusing on removing barriers of the affordability, devices, and services of information for persons with disabilities. 45 On 5 February 2022, China ratified the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled. In 2021, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology launched a whole year Action Plan to modify the accessibility of internet applications for elderly people and persons with disabilities, mitigating “ digital divides. ” 46 The Action Plan explicitly listed 158 websites and applications targeted for modification, ranging from those of governments, news outlets, airlines and railways, social media, and e-commerce, to search engines, banks, travel agencies, health services. By 2022, over 800 government entities modified their web accessibility, 320 websites passed an accessibility audit, and nearly 100 applications added accessibility features such as large fonts, high contrast, and easy to read pages. 47 The provision of accessible services such as sign language interpretation are mentioned in the Rule on the Construction of Accessible Environment, Guiding Opinions on Strengthening the Construction of Broadcasting and Television Public Service System, and National Basic Public Service Standards. China has also issued its Second National Sign Language and Braille Standardization Action Plan (2021-2025), and the Promotion Plan for National Universal Sign Language. \nIn 2022, the draft Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments solicited public opinions. The second draft was released for public comments in April 2023. The legislation is widely recognized as a catalytic opportunity for raising the awareness of accessibility, and specifying the implementation measures at the local level. Expert informants involved in the legislative process praised the draft law for emphasizing accessibility at the planning stage, and legally recognizing the universal benefits of accessibility. Controversies remain about how strict the enforcement will be. OPDs are concerned about the lack of clarity on accountability and remedies, 48 the insufficient attention to the needs of persons with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities, 49 and the significant room for discretion for duty-bearers to not comply with the law, 50 making it a symbolic law with “ no teeth. ” \nFormal evaluation mechanisms are being established, such as the Evaluation System of the Elderlyoriented and Barrier-free Internet Services, 51 and Barrier-free Facility Evaluation Standards for Civic Constructions. 52 In some cities, persons with disabilities have participated in monitoring accessibility through citizen hotlines (e.g. 12345), and local-level “ barrier-free inspectors ” typically formed by local government, experts, and representatives of persons with disabilities. 53 Beijing recently released a comprehensive database (https://data.beijing.gov.cn/wzazt/) on the locations and conditions of accessible facilities in the city. 54 Consultations reveal that major international events (e.g. Olympic/Paralympic Games) and China ’s ageing population are key opportunities for promoting accessibility. 3.2 Key Gaps in Accessibility \nBuilt Environment Despite increased policy commitment and investment, barriers in built environment remain. Data on the budgeting and monitoring of accessibility are not consistently available. According to a 2017 national survey conducted by China Consumer Society and CDPF, the overall coverage of barrier-free facilities (including accessible exits and entrances, elevators, wheelchair accessible bathrooms, and sign language proficiency among staff) in Chinese cities was 40.6%, among which hospitals had the highest coverage (67.4%) and commercial areas were the lowest (31.2%). Among existing barrier-free facilities, many were unavailable, occupied, under-maintained, and poorly designed. Public satisfaction rate for accessibility was also low. The survey shows barriers including technical challenges in architectural modification, lack of government coordination, lack of business incentives, and discriminatory attitudes towards consumers with disabilities. 55 \nInformal monitoring by OPDs also exist. For instance, a survey of over 600 travelers with disabilities shows that the top five barriers that persons with disabilities face when traveling are lack of accessible facilities (61.7%), unavailability of information about accessibility (46.4%), inaccessible hotels and transportation (41.9%), lack of accessible services (27.2%), and negative attitudes by service providers (18.8%). 56 The lack of barrier-free facilities not only impedes equal participation of persons with disabilities in society but also poses threats to the personal safety of persons with disabilities, as revealed by two incidents caused by poor accessibility leading to the deaths of two activists with disabilities. 57 58 The gaps further widen in rural areas. 59 Information and communications Gaps continue to exist between the high demand for accessible information and the poor supply. First, as consultations for this report reveal, the accessibility of websites and applications remain fragmented and uneven. Some software developed “ accessible versions ” as alternative services provided for users with disabilities, but these versions are often inferior to and less updated than mainstream versions. Some applications become even less accessible after modification, because of the lack of participation of users with disabilities. Lacking systemic planning and coordination, iteration of applications can overwrite previous accessibility features. \nThe legislative system of information accessibility is incomplete, according to the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT). 60 Current laws and regulations lack coherence, clarity of responsibilities, and the power to enforce. Existing standards for accessibility are “ encouraged ” rather than mandatory. They are impractical, poorly implemented, and outdated. In addition, CAICT points out that internet applications typically fail to consider the needs of persons with disabilities at the design phase, making it difficult for modifications later on. 61 Accessible services The draft law on accessible environment included provisions on accessible services. Currently, basic social services in support of access to information, such as sign language interpretation, relay services, live captioning, alternative texts, audio description, and easy-to-read formats for public information, are still lacking. These problems were heightened during emergency communication during COVID-19. Deaf/hearing impaired informants note that most news reporting does not include captioning. Highquality sign language interpretation is rare. Advocates still cite an early survey published by CDPF in 1998, revealing that 78 –89% of deaf people understood less than 60% of the Chinese sign language signed on TV news channels. 62 According to the National Sign Language and Braille Research Center in 2014, only 63.1% of deaf students “ somewhat ” understood the sign language used by hearing teachers in deaf schools. 63 \nDeaf informants consulted highlight that the quantity and quality of sign language interpretation have significant gaps in China. They are concerned that, due to hearing-centric policies that prioritize speech therapy and hearing rehabilitation over sign language acquisition, children with hearing impairments experience various degrees of language deprivation, resulting in the systemic exclusions of deaf/hard of hearing people in education, work, and social life. Even in disability inclusion programs and events, deaf informants have experienced a lack of meaningful language accommodation and equal participation with hearing persons with disabilities. \n61 Ibid. OPDs consulted for the report identified the following key gaps in accessibility as the most urgent: low public awareness of accessibility, weak enforcement of laws and standards, and the lack of participation of persons with disabilities in designing, monitoring, and evaluating accessibility. Expert informants note that enforcement of accessibility policies requires strong inter-ministerial coordination, which DPFs lack sufficient authority for. Awareness of local government leadership and the support of more powerful ministries is crucial. OPDs are also calling for strengthening the digital literacy of persons with disabilities, which is positively correlated with income levels in China. 64 A CDPF joined study found that due to lack of internet access or devices, prohibition by parents, and insufficient skills to use accessibility features, the usage rate of internet among youth with disabilities (aged 10-18) is merely 68%, significantly lower than youth without disabilities (94.9%). 65 While digital tools are important means of production, there lacks systemic assessment of the digital literacy of persons with disabilities. 4. Inclusive Service Delivery \n4.1 Disability assessment and referral systems China ’s current disability determination system does not align with the CRPD ’s social model definition of disability, or the WHO classification system. The Classification and Grading Criteria for Disability (GB/T 26341-2010) provides national standards for six types of disability, namely visual impairment/blind, Hearing impairment/deaf, Physical disability, Speech disability, Intellectual disability, and Psychiatric disabilities, with four grades under each type. Legal determination of disability is conducted by designated medical institutions, and the recognition of disability comes in the form of a certificate issued by the CDPF, which is a prerequisite for applying for disability subsidies and functions as an identification to access a range of benefits and services. Early i dentification and intervention mechanisms for children aged 0-6 are promoted by the N ational Disability Prevention Action Plan (2021-2025) and the Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities (2017). In 2021, 278,695 children with disabilities received basic rehabilitation services nationwide. 66 Quality of the services, disaggregated by type of disability, location, and gender, needs further assessment. \nPredominantly based on biomedical criteria, the system does not account for the social and environmental factors that affect people ’s capacity to undertake activities of daily life and participation. The determination criteria also prioritize people who could not recover after receiving treatment for over a year, and does not account for temporary impairments. 67 \nThe DPFs regularly update and monitor data of certified persons with disabilities, as basis for service provision and policy making. Among 85 million officially estimated persons with disabilities, only 38 million (44.7%) hold a disability certificate as of 2021, and 57.8% of them are men. 68 The low rate of certificate holding is in part due to stigma, lack of information, inaccessibility of the determination system, and 68中国残疾人联合会. (2021). 3-2全国持证残疾人人口基础库主要数据. \nmismatch with the official criteria. 69 Persons with disabilities can make complaints through the government service hotlines or petitioning (xinfang) reception system/staff/office of local governments and DPFs. 4.2 Disability Support Services The 13 th Five-Year Plan to Promote Equal Provision of Basic Public Services dedicated a section on basic services for persons with disabilities, including social protection, nursing care, rehabilitation, education, vocational training and employment services, culture and sports, and accessible environment support. 70 The 14 th five-year plan on disability aims to increase the access, availability and diversity of support allowances and services. CDPF is the main coordinator of service provision for persons with disabilities. 71 Disability support services are mainly funded by the government, and delivered through direct service or government procurement of services from public institutions, registered social organizations including social workers, or private service providers. 72 According to the Disabled Persons Service Provider Management Measures (2018), CDPF and its branches are commissioned to supervise disability service providers. Local government departments shall make plans for service provision based on the population size, distribution, and service needs of persons with disabilities in their jurisdiction, and include service providers in the basic public service system. Service providers are required to conduct needs assessment and evaluation to design and update services, and provide accessible facilities. 73 Most public services are provided for disability certificate holders within local jurisdictions with low or no cost. Due to the variety and decentralization of services, the general number of service providers to persons with disabilities ratio is unknown. A key grassroots service coordination mechanism within the DPF system is the “ special commissioners on disability issues, ” who are typically persons with disabilities or their family members, responsible for home visits, needs assessment, local-level disability work planning, policy coordination, event organizing, and conflict resolution. 74 As of 2021, there are 57,208 commissioners at the county level, and 494,047 commissioners at village and community levels across China. 75 This means, roughly 15 community-level DPF staff are hired to support per 1000 disability certificate holders, and their numbers are unevenly distributed geographically. More full-time commissioners are concentrated in urban areas, and commissioners in rural areas often combine multiple roles of coordinating disability, civil affairs, women ’s issues in one person. 76 The commissioners are often overworked, under-equipped, and under-skilled. 77 Informants note that the commissioners do not usually work with independent OPDs. Rehabilitation Rehabilitation services are stipulated by the Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities (2017). Rehabilitation services are mainly delivered through the health system, DPF system, and the civil affairs system. Children aged 0-6 are prioritized, and offered full coverage of rehabilitation services. 78 As of 2017, 65.6% of persons with disabilities had access to rehabilitation services. 79 In 2021, 47.8% of those receiving rehabilitation services are persons with physical disabilities, and another 18.5% are people with psychiatric disabilities. 80 In recent years, progress has been made to expand rehabilitation from centralized medical rehabilitation to community-based rehabilitation by OPDs and self-help groups. 81 OPDs consulted call for more rehabilitation services aimed at community inclusion such as in educational or vocational settings. Assistive Technologies Public provision of assistive devices are delivered through CDPF ’s rehabilitation departments and the civil affairs system. In 2017, 2.4 million persons with disabilities received assistive devices, 82 including white canes, vision-assistive devices, wheelchairs, prosthetic limbs, hearing aids, and cochlear implants. Consultations show that gaps exist in obtaining affordable, accessible, usable, and customized assistive devices for persons with disabilities. Currently, most assistive devices are still delivered through the government ’s centralized planning, which resulted in the lack of customization, preference for products with lower bidding price over quality, and rigid restrictions for eligibility. 83 In recent years, cash subsidies for assistive technologies of the users ’ own choice are being piloted in places like Beijing, Liaoning, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. 84 Many user-friendly assistive technologies provided by private sector remain unaffordable for most persons with disabilities without subsides from the government. Care Services Officially, care services for persons with disabilities include home-based care, day care, and residential care services, targeting people with intellectual, psychosocial disabilities, and people with severe physical disabilities. 85 National standards were set in 2019. 86 Some care facilities offer “ assistive employment ” programs for both rehabilitation and employment purposes through low skill labor such as handicraft making. As of 2021, 608988 disability certificate holders are residing in 11,278 institutionalized care services nationwide, including boarding institutions, day care, and more comprehensive facilities. 87 Consultation shows that the care responsibility mostly falls on family members, especially women, with little alternative options, but some policies continue to encourage a family-centered care approach. \nFor mental health care, data on the proportion of government budget spent on institutionalized care versus community-based support are not available. 88 Although specific plan and timeline to transition to community-based support (as per the CRPD) is unknown, China is promoting community-based rehabilitation for persons with psychosocial disabilities, setting the goal to cover at least 80% of counties across the country by 2025. 89 4.3 Mainstream Services \nSocial protection China ’s social protection system for persons with disabilities include three main mechanisms: 1) welfare subsidies (fuli butie), such as living subsidies for disabled persons in hardships, and care subsidies for persons with severe disabilities; 2) social insurance subsidies (shehui baoxian butie), such as pension and medical insurance subsidies; and 3) special assistance (zhuanxiang jiuzhu), such as minimum living standard guarantee (dibao), and assistance for disaster, healthcare, education, and housing. 90 \nChina has reached wide coverage of social protection for persons with disabilities. For example, living allowances for poor people with disabilities and nursing subsidies for severely disabled persons now cover more than 24 million people. 10.67 million people with disabilities are included in the system of subsistence allowances. All poor persons with disabilities are covered by basic medical insurance and serious illness insurance, according to an official white paper. 91 \nBy 2021, China has declared success in lifting more than 7 million persons with disabilities out of absolute poverty. 92 Yet persons with disabilities remain economically marginalized. Experts estimate that 36% to 44% of certified persons with disabilities in China can be considered under “ relative poverty. ” 93 In 2019, over 30% of total disability certificate holders received living subsidies for disabled persons in hardships, and care subsidies for persons with severe disabilities. 94 Social protection remains an important source of income for persons with disabilities, making up 13.2% of total disabled persons ’ household income on average. 95 Households with the lowest income are most dependent on social protection, but their average income from social protection was merely CNY 2,631.30 per year, as of 2019. 96 Health \nGeneral healthcare China ’s mainstream health policies and strategies predominantly regards disability as a target for prevention and clinical rehabilitation. The Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities (2017), the 14 th Five-year Plan on disability, 97 and the National Disability Prevention Action Plan (2021-2025), 98 all define preventing disability as specific health targets. The Healthy China 2030 Plan re-emphasizes the rehabilitation and prevention of disabilities, with a provision on “ enhancing the accessibility of medical institutions, and improving medical services for people with disabilities. ” 99 Some hospitals do provide accessible volunteer services, especially for persons with hearing or visual impairments. Consultations for this report reveal that mainstream medical system remain largely inaccessible, or unaffordable for certain communities of persons with rare diseases, and adopts a strong medical model of disability that fails to connect the patients ’ medical needs with social services. \nAccess to general healthcare is uneven. A recent analysis based on data from the National Survey on Basic Public Service Delivery of Persons with Disabilities revealed high rate of unmet healthcare needs. 15.4% of persons with disabilities lacked regular medical care when ill, and 45.6% reported needing more targeted rehabilitation services than they had. Rural residents were 13-40% more likely to lack healthcare, which was in part the result of the unequal access to health facilities, social participation, and health professionals at the community level. Among the respondents, persons with multiple disabilities experienced the highest levels of overall unmet healthcare needs, and people with physical disabilities had more unmet needs in rehabilitation. 100 Further, among China ’s over five million children with disabilities, 63% did not receive adequate healthcare, due to poor information, shortage of services, and affordability. 101 General health data disaggregated by disability, such as evidence of inequalities in health faced by persons with disabilities (corresponds to the OHCHR CRPD-SDG indicators) are not available. \nSexual and Reproductive Health and Rights Women with disabilities face additional barriers in accessing healthcare, especially sexual and reproductive health (SRH). 102 Women and youth with disabilities face higher risks of sexual violence, forced abortion, contraception and sterilization, financial and other forms of control, 103 yet they have limited access to SRH information and services. 104 In a UNESCO China and Humanity & Inclusion study, less than 20% young persons with disabilities in both urban and rural areas reported having counselling, referral services, or free contraceptives in their schools or communities. 105 A study co-funded by the CDPF \n105 Ibid. \nand State Council Committee on Women and Children ’s Work revealed large gaps in disabled women ’s access to healthcare and rehabilitation services. For instance, in Heilongjiang province, merely 50.2% women with disabilities received prenatal check during their last childbirth, 20.4 percentage points lower than women in general. Women with disabilities in rural areas had an even lower prenatal checking rate of 36.2%, and were significantly less likely (46.7 percentage points less) than urban women with disabilities to receive in-hospital child delivery care, indicating sharp disparity between urban and rural service provision. 106 Women with disabilities in poor households also experience higher prevalence of SRH related diseases. 107 An 2015 study tested the SRH knowledge of 248 women with disabilities, and the correction rate was 45.14%. 108 In response, UNESCO, UNFPA, Marie Stopes International, and Youren Foundation have conducted comprehensive sexuality education for persons with disabilities. \nChina ’s 2015 Anti-Domestic Violence Law, the Healthy China 2030 Plan, the Outline for Women's Development in China (2021-2030), the Outline for Children ’s Development in China (2021-2030), and China CDC ’s “ Towards 2030: Achieving Equal Access to Reproductive Health — China Reproductive Health Strategic Framework, ” provide important policy momentum for the protection of SRH rights for persons with disabilities and provision of more inclusive SRH services. More than a health issue, SRH issues affect girls ’ attendance in schools, women ’s participation in the labor force, women ’s voice at home and communities, the safety and right to life of persons with disabilities. For this reason, expert informants argue that SRH presents an effective entry point for influencing the general healthcare system, and comprehensively addressing gender-based discrimination faced by women in education, work, and social participation. Education The right to education for persons with disabilities is stipulated by China ’s Constitution, the LPPD, the Law on Compulsory Education, and the Regulations on the Education of Persons with Disabilities. The Ministry of Education (MOE) regulate and oversee all schools providing education for persons with disabilities, in coordination with local health departments, civil affairs departments, and the DPFs. 109 According to the MOE, the enrolment rate in compulsory education among children with disabilities has reached over 95%. 110 The Action Plan for Special Education Development (2021-2025), issued in 2022 by the MOE, planned to expand the coverage of compulsory education for children with disabilities to 97% by 2025. 111 China has taken steps towards a more inclusive education approach. In 2017, China revised the Regulations on the Education of Persons with Disabilities, 112 more firmly stating the principle of inclusive education and anti-discrimination than the 1994 version. Article 3 of the new Regulations explicitly stipulates that “ general education approach, ” namely inclusive education, should be given priority. According to the government, as of 2017, over 50% of students with disabilities receiving compulsory \neducation studied at regular schools. 113 The number of students with disabilities at regular schools has increased from 239,000 in 2015 to 439,000 in 2020. 114 \nMeanwhile, the revised Regulations, as well as policy directives such as the National Long-Term Educational Reform and Development Plan (2010 –2020), continues to encourage the expansion of special education. Namely, China takes a “ double-track approach ” that promotes both special education and inclusive education. 115 Challenges to inclusive education include China ’s typically large class size, the lack of special education expertise among teachers, limited resources, and ableist attitudes. Further, the double-track approach places emphasis on students ’ abilities to adapt to ordinary classes instead of capacity building of regular education system to attend to the diverse learning needs of learners with and without disabilities. The system also entrenches the rigid separation of expertise between regular school and special school teachers, and creates incentives for the special education system to retain students within special schools rather than supporting them in an inclusive setting. 116 \nPreschool and Compulsory education (elementary and middle school) Students with disabilities typically receive education through systems of special education, special classes in mainstream schools, learning in regular classes (sui ban jiu du), or home schooling (song jiao shang men). At the pre-school level, kindergartens lack the support system and technical skills to include children with disabilities, despite policy support such as the 14 th Special Education Development and Improvement Action Plan. 117 \nAccess to compulsory education is still uneven. In remoteand rural areas, students with disabilities receive lower levels of education, less access to special education teachers, and other support services necessary for education. 118 Students who learn in regular classes lack quality education, as regular school teachers lack special education capacity. Regular schools that do have special education resource centers tend to prioritize facilities and equipment, downplaying the role of specialized staff. For home schooling, students with multiple or severe disabilities, including people with autism and cerebral palsy, face significant barriers in obtaining quality education. 119 High school and vocational education Fewer students with disabilities receive post-compulsory education such as high school and vocational education, compared to students without disabilities. Between 2012 and 2016, roughly 30% of persons with disabilities, and over 85% of persons without disabilities entered high school and vocational schools. 120 Vocational education for persons with disabilities are disproportionately situated in large cities and have limited enrolment capacity, leaving the vocational training needs for students with disabilities 116 Ibid. \nhttps://k.sina.com.cn/article_1881124713_701faf69020015r80.html#/ largely unmet. 121 Existing schools also focus on students with hearing or visual impairments, and lack the expertise to train persons with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities. Current vocational trainings do not coordinate well with special schools, or future employers. 122 Higher education Higher education remains largely inaccessible to persons with disabilities. As of 2019, a total of 43,900 persons with disabilities were enrolled in regular college in the entire country, 123 which means roughly 10,000 persons with disabilities graduate from college every year. By contrast, the number of college graduates without disabilities in 2020 was 8.74 million, 124 over 800 times more than persons with disabilities. Barriers faced by persons with disabilities prior to higher education include low primary school enrolment rate among persons with disabilities in rural areas, high dropout rate among children with disabilities, low educational expectation for persons with disabilities due to deeply entrenched stigma, inadequate support in school including reasonable accommodations, and limited options in colleges and majors open to persons with disabilities. 125 Due to continued advocacy, in 2014, a national policy began to allow the application for reasonable accommodations in the national college entrance exam (gaokao), and in 2017, rules on supporting students with disabilities taking regular gaokao were issued. 126 As a result, more students with disabilities were able to attend the exam, but the acceptance rate remains disproportionately low. Employment and livelihood The right to equal employment opportunities is stipulated in China ’s Constitution, the Labor Law, the LPPD, and Regulations on the Employment of Disabled Persons (2007). The Employment Promotion Law (2007) also contains an anti-discrimination provision regarding people with disabilities. 127 As a priority area of China ’s state disability programs, employment is typically included in the national five-year plans for disability. The latest 14 th Five-Year Plan sets goals for diversifying the types and improving the quality of employment of persons with disabilities. In 2022, the State Council adopted the Three-Year Action Plan on Promoting Disability Employment (2022-2024), setting the target of generating one million new jobs for persons with disabilities over three years, creating an important policy momentum. \nAs a form of affirmative action, China has adopted an employment quota scheme, one of the most important policy devices for promoting employment of persons with disabilities. Implemented in the late 1980s, this nationwide, legally binding scheme applies to all public and private sector organizations with a workforce exceeding 30 employees and operating for more than 3 years. It stipulates that at least 1.5% of all public or private entities ’ workforce must be persons with a disability, and non-compliance shall result in financial penalty paid to the Disabled Employment Security Fund (DESF), managed by the CDPF. 128 In practice, the quota policy has been poorly enforced, and even created perverse incentives such as “ fake employment ” practices that rent a disabled person ’s certificate as a token of compliance without real work opportunity. 129 Some OPDs point out that the policy may have caused more disability-based discrimination. 130 Consultations further show the complexity of the issue. Many persons with disabilities, due to systemic education and employment exclusion, end up depending on the income from renting their certificates to private companies. The funding scheme also contains a conflict of interest, as some local governments rely on DESF as a source of revenue, incentivizing officials to collect more fines than promoting real employment. 131 The overall labor participation rate remains low for persons with disabilities. Although official data estimates over half of working-age people with disabilities are employed, 132 about three quarters of these jobs are categorized as either agriculture, cultivation, or “ flexible ” employment, 133 namely temporary or part-time jobs (see Figure 1). Persons with disabilities are significantly less likely to work in higher skilled white-collar occupations. 134 As key targets of poverty alleviation, as of 2018, households of persons with disabilities earned less than 60% of the national average and the gap continues to widen. 135 Among all, persons with intellectual disabilities were least accepted by employers. According to a report based on surveys of 203 families in Guangzhou, only 2% of persons with intellectual disabilities in Guangzhou had meaningful employment. 136 A recent survey of 328 companies shows that 70.4% persons with disabilities hired by these employers are people with physical impairments, and 59.8% are in supporting or administrative roles. 137 \n131 In consultation, informants have identified multiple systemic barriers to inclusive employment, including: \n• inadequate access to equal education opportunities, including the lack of high-quality basic education, as well as vocational training and skill development opportunities for persons with disabilities; \n\n• the lack of anti-discrimination and disability mainstreaming laws and policies; \n\n• lack of public sector role models for disability-inclusive employment; \n\n• lack of disability inclusion expertise among employment service providers; \n\n• discriminatory social attitudes towards persons with disabilities by families and friends, employers, co-workers, and even persons with disabilities themselves; \n\n• Lack of accessibility and reasonable accommodations to and at workplaces. \nILO ’s Global Business and Disability Network (GBDN) China Chapter has made progress in influencing the private sector to recruit and include persons with disabilities. While attracting local companies to join GBDN-China and promoting inclusive employment practices remains a challenge, GBDN-China presents an opportunity to generate good practices and share experiences with other companies in China. Another key opportunity is the government ’s recent effort to promote public sector employment of persons with disabilities. Until now, persons with disabilities face overt discrimination when applying for government positions, including rigid physical examination criteria, lack of reasonable accommodations and accessibility, and rejection based on certain types or degrees of disability. According to an early study based on government information disclosure requests, merely 0.02% to 0.39% of civil servants in government institutions were persons with disabilities as of 2011. 139 Recent policies, such as the Measures on Public Organs, Institutions, and State-owned Enterprises Taking the Lead in Arranging Disabled Persons ’ Employment 140 and the State Council ’s 2022 Three-Year Action Plan on Promoting Disability Employment (2022-2024) 141 , have highlighted the responsibilities of the public sector in hiring persons with disabilities and fulfilling the quota policy. OPDs consulted praise the policies as a step towards better ensuring the right to work for persons with disabilities and showcasing best practices for private employers. According to government informants, currently statistics of public servants with disabilities are being collected, local institutions are submitting their hiring plans and reserving headcounts, and a priority in 2023 is to promote the revision of public servant physical exam standards. Access to justice According to a UNDP China report on Equal Access to Justice for Persons with Disabilities, 142 persons with disabilities face significant challenges in accessing the justice system. These include: \n• “ Limited legal knowledge. \n\n• Unaffordability of current legal services, and the general lack of knowledge about free legal aid services. \n\n• For persons with [psychosocial] and intellectual disabilities and others who are placed under adult guardianship, their legal capacity is restricted. \n\n• In the process of providing criminal legal aid for persons with visual, hearing, speech and mental impairments, there is a lack of effective and timely support in communication and information accessibility. \n\n• For persons with physical or visual impairments, if and when they face discrimination in the realms of transportation, education and employment, they cannot resort to the judicial system for equality. \n\n• Women with disabilities are more vulnerable to rights infringement and have less access to justice. \n\n• Continuous social discrimination and prejudice that all [persons with disabilities] face critically restricts their ability to navigate the judicial system effectively in order to realize their human rights and also undermines their confidence and adds to their already existing dismay. ” The report concludes that the key to improving equal access to justice is greater accessibility support and reasonable accommodations throughout the judicial process. \nParticipation in public and political life China is not short of policies and laws that protect the political participation right of persons with disabilities on paper. The 2008 LPPD stipulates that “ Persons with disabilities shall enjoy equal rights with other citizens in political, economic, cultural and social respects and in family life as well ” (Article 3) and that “ competent departments in charge of the organization of elections shall facilitate persons with disabilities to vote in elections. Braille ballots shall be available wherever possible ” (Article 56). 143 Mechanisms for participating in public and political life for persons with disabilities in China include taking part in voting and elections, joining representative bodies such as all levels of NPC and CPPCC, or working for state organs. There is no specific quota for persons with disabilities in the People ’s Congresses or Political Consultation Parties. In 2020, DPFs assisted 735 policy recommendations by people ’s congress and political consultation party delegates, and handled 1109 cases of their recommendations. 144 In practice, the lack of reasonable accommodations in political processes, the restrictions posed by mandatory public servant medical examinations, the tokenization of government employment quota, the preference for people with less severe disabilities, discriminatory social attitudes, and inadequate access to equal education, all contribute to the low rate of political participation of persons with disabilities. 145 Among persons with disabilities working at state institutions, persons with physical disabilities, and those with less severe disabilities are preferred. As of 2018, among local DPFs, 69.3% of municipal-level DPFs and 49.8% of county-level DPFs had staff members with disabilities. 146 As a step forward, in 2021, CDPF and four other ministries and departments issued a policy guidance regarding employing persons with disabilities in state organs, public institutions, and state-owned enterprises, explicitly requiring public sector employers to reasonably define the physical exam requirements for candidates with disabilities, and must not judge the candidates ’ health on the basis of their disability. 147 5. CRPD-compliant budgeting and financial management There are three main mechanisms for the Chinese government to fund disability-related programs: regular public budget, special subsidy, and disability employment security fund (DESF). 148 From 2013 to 2017, the fiscal allocations from all levels of the government for persons with disabilities added up to over CNY 180 billion. 149 In 2021, the national public budget expenditure on disability affairs was CNY 70.6 billion, taking up 0.287% of the total national general public budget expenditure (24567.3 billion). 150 Compared to the scale of Chinese government budget (50-70 billion CNY per year), budgets of ongoing national development and humanitarian programs funded by international development partners are negligible. \nThe expenditures on disability affairs in 2021 included 30.6 billion on living and care subsidies (43.3%), 7.2 billion on rehabilitation, 6.6 billion on employment and poverty reduction, 5.5 billion on administrative costs, and 18.8 billion categorized as other expenditures. 151 In addition, CNY 16.1 billion of national public budget was spent on special education, 0.43% of the total education expenditures (3746.9 billion). 152 Article 48 of the 2017 Regulations on the Education of Persons with Disabilities stipulates that “ the financial funds allocated for compulsory education by local people ’s governments at all levels, as well as extra charges for education collected by these governments, shall have a certain proportion set aside for compulsory education for children and adolescents with disabilities. ” 153 Yet the proportion is not specified. \n146于娣.(2020).中国特色残联组织功能研究(博士学位论文,武汉理工大学). \nMost funding allocated for educating persons with disabilities are spent on special schools, and inclusive education in regular schools lacks financial support. 154 In 2021, The Action Plan for Special Education Development (2021-2025), issued in 2022 by the MOE, intends to increase the average government expenditure on compulsory education for children with disabilities from 6,000 yuan per student now to 7,000 yuan by 2025. 155 \nThe disability employment security fund (DESF), a penalty paid by employers for failing to comply with the employment quota policy, is designed to incentivize the employment of persons with disabilities in mainstream workplaces. In practice, employers prefer to pay fines or rent disability certificates over actually hiring persons with disabilities. The DESF scheme creates a conflict of interest, as some local governments treat employment security fund as a source of revenue, incentivizing officials to collect more fines than promoting real employment. 156 The amount of DESF increased by ten times between 2005 and 2013, but the quota-based employment rate of persons with disabilities dropped. 157 OPDs and the public are also concerned about the lack of transparency of the distribution and expenditures of the fund. 158 6. Accountability and governance \n6.1 Inclusive evidence and data gathering systems Two national sample surveys on disability were conducted in 1987 and 2006. There is no updated national disability sample survey so far. The CDPF and its local branches publish annual data updates, including statistical briefs and yearbooks on disability affairs. Key priorities of the DPF system are monitored, including rehabilitation, education, employment, social protection, poverty reduction, culture, sports, and rights protection. Other data collection efforts include the annual income level survey for households of persons with disabilities since 2017, conducted by the CDPF with the approval of the National Statistics Bureau, sampling over 10,000 households every year. 159 \nA recent initiative of China ’s disability data system is a national database that regularly and comprehensively collects information from all disability certificate holders, across the country. Key data is publicized on CDPF ’s website, and accessible for public use: https://www.cdpf.org.cn/zwgk/zccx/ndsj/zhsjtj/2021zh/87373b76fe2e47789b24f2d481afebbc.htm. \nData in some thematic areas are disaggregated by age, types of disability, and location, but not by gender. Existing data do not assess barriers to participation, or intersectional issues related to disability other than poverty. Data experts consulted raised concerns about the reliability of self-reported data by local governments, and the limited scope of disability certificate holders. \nA common response among informants is the general lack of reliable data on disability, let alone data specifically aligned with the disability definition of the CRPD, or SDG indicators. Government informants https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/90124/CC035_12_03_Disability_Workplace_China_Situation_Assess.pdf?sequence=1 \nalso note the lack of disaggregated data by disability in national statistical datasets across sectors. The data gaps and opportunities that informants identified include: \n• an updated accounting of the number of persons with disabilities based on definitions aligned with the CRPD, including those without the disability certificates; \n\n• data on people who newly acquired disabilities; \n\n• data on marginalized communities, such as persons with psychosocial disabilities, women with disabilities, and persons with disabilities residing in rural areas; \n\n• inclusive education, and employment data disaggregated by types of disabilities; \n\n• language use (Chinese sign language, written Chinese, signing exact Chinese) among people with hearing impairments \n\n• economic impact of the employment of persons with disabilities, including on their families and communities; \n\n• and mainstream, national data disaggregated by disability. 6.2 National accountability mechanisms Officially, the State Council Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work is responsible for promoting the implementation of the CRPD. Information on the effectiveness of the Committee in mainstreaming CRPD across all sectors and levels of government is lacking. 160 There is no independent mechanism appointed to monitor the implementation of the CRPD. 161 \nThe CDPF is the focal point overseeing the implementation of the CRPD, responsible for monitoring whether the creation and implementation of policies and plans relating to the rights of persons with disabilities are consistent with the CRPD principles. Some CSOs were invited to consultations for CRPD reporting but OPDs were underrepresented. 162 Most CSOs involved were specialized associations funded by the CDPF, or service provision organizations led by people without disabilities. In 2018, the State Council Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work published China ’s draft CRPD country report for public opinions, but the time window was fewer than 24 hours, making it impractical for meaningful comments to be incorporated. 163 A few OPDs have engaged in CRPD monitoring through shadow reporting, but most OPDs consulted have not engaged in CRPD monitoring mechanisms. \nChina has completed its combined second and third periodic reports. The review sessions concluded in September 2022. Major findings of the concluding observations suggest that China ’s disability-related policies and laws are not yet fully aligned with the social model of disability, OPDs independent from the state lack meaningful participation in policy-making, and China ’s legal system lacks anti-discrimination frameworks and effective provisions guaranteeing reasonable accommodations. 164 \nIn China ’s National Plan on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 165 disability was explicitly mentioned in China ’s action plan for goal 4 (quality education), 8 (decent work and economic growth), and 10 (reduced inequalities). In China ’s Progress Report on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2021), persons with disabilities were reported as beneficiaries of China ’s progress on SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG4 (quality education), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). 166 Concrete achievements include: \n• “ To ensure the right to education for people with disabilities, the second phase of the Special Educational Enhancement Program was fully completed from 2017 to 2020. By the end of 2020, the enrollment rate of children with disabilities in compulsory education exceeded 95%; a total of 880,800 special education students had been enrolled, 388,800 more than in 2016. ” \n\n• “ From 2016 to 2020, 1.81 million people with disabilities got employed in urban and rural areas. As of the end of 2020, 2.39 million people with disabilities obtained flexible employment (including community and home employment). ” 167 \nIn China ’s 2021 Voluntary National Review, people with disabilities are mentioned as beneficiaries of China ’s efforts in SDG 1.5, the world ’s largest social security system, and COVID response. No specific evidence was provided regarding the implementation of the disability-related goals listed in China ’s Action Plan. 168 \nChina has not yet established an independent mechanism for monitoring human rights. 169 Since 2009, China has released four national human rights action plans. Outcomes of the plans are regularly reported in government issued human rights white papers. 170 The latest plan is the Human Rights Action Plan of China (2021-2025). The Action Plan includes persons with disabilities as one of the “ special groups ” and recognized the intersectional issues faced by children, women, and elderly people with disabilities. The Action Plan dedicates a targeted section on disability, stating “ ensuring the right to participate ” as a priority. Implementation of the Action Plan is mainly monitored through a joint meeting mechanism. 7. Cross cutting issues \n7.1 Participation Within the government system, there exist formal mechanisms to facilitate OPD participation in policymaking and decision-making. For instance, the Disabled People ’s Representative Congress, which is meant to function as the disabled persons ’ equivalent of the National People ’s Congress, represents the highest power overseeing the CDPF and is required to reserve at least half of its seats to persons with disabilities and their families/friends. 171 The five specialized associations, predominantly functioning as internal parts of the DPFs, are dedicated to serving the interests of people with the kinds of disabilities they represent, and are usually headed by people with the same kinds of disabilities or their families/friends. The CDPF also encourages more persons with disabilities and their families/friends to become NPC and CPPCC delegates. \n167 Ibid. \nOPDs independent from the government are involved in policy-making and decision-making to a much less extent, as consultations show. Most laws and regulations concerning disability pass without the formal input of non-state affiliated OPDs. An exception is the recent draft Law on Construction of BarrierFree Environments. The draft law was open for public comments in 2022 and 2023, and multiple OPDs organized public consultations and submitted comments. Results of their advocacy remain to be seen. Despite the lack of formal engagement, some independent OPDs have leveraged informal channels through key decision-makers, academics, NPC and CPPCC delegates to influence policy and law making. For instance, informants note that the inclusion of accessibility provisions in the Legal Aid Law was achieved through OPD collaboration with academic think tanks. \nConsultations show that formal mechanisms for participation tend to be highly selective, and exclusively accessed by CSOs, OPDs, or individuals with disabilities that are affiliated with or endorsed by the government, who take a rather service-oriented than rights-based approach. Most formal mechanisms are symbolic. As informants comment, meaningful dialogues are difficult due to power imbalances, and a lack of recognition of OPDs ’ leadership in disability inclusion. Meanwhile, the effect of informal mechanisms is not guaranteed, and depends highly on personal circumstances and political opportunities. Most grassroots OPDs, in reality, lack access to such mechanisms. Comprehensive assessment of different approaches for OPDs to influence decision making is not available, and is worthy of future research. \nAccording to various stakeholders, key areas of improvement for OPDs to make engagement with duty bearers include: better knowledge of existing policies; more access to official channels; stronger coordination between OPDs and policy makers/advocates (such as think thanks, scholars, and NPC/CPPCC representatives); higher awareness of the expertise and capacity of OPDs; and mechanisms that prioritizes the voices of independent OPDs. 7.2 Inclusion of marginalised groups \nPeople with disabilities with low income The correlation between poverty and disability is globally known, and China is no exception. Officially, over 7 million persons with disabilities have been lifted out of absolute poverty by 2021. 172 Yet persons with disabilities remain economically marginalized. Depending on the evaluation criteria, experts estimate that 36% to 44% of certified persons with disabilities in China can be considered under “ relative poverty. ” 173 As a CDPF official points out, households of persons with disabilities persistently earn less than 60% of the national average, and the gap continues to widen (see Figure 2). 174 \nHouseholds of persons with disabilities typically have “ high costs, low income. ” In 2018, healthcare expenses of families of persons with disabilities make up 26.3% of total household expenditures, 1.6 times that of the national average. The Engel's Coefficient (food expenditure to overall expenditure ratio) of persons with disabilities was as high as 40.9% in 2018, significantly higher than the national average (28.4%). 176 The least well-off among people with disabilities live in rural areas. In 2018, urban households of persons with disabilities earned 1.7 times more than rural households. Among the rural population with disabilities, over half have severe disabilities (holders of Level 1 or Level 2 certificates). 177 This indicates a greater gap in meeting their needs for care, accessibility, rehabilitation, assistive devices, basic public services, and work, exacerbating their poverty. \nPeople with intellectual and/or psychosocial disabilities People with intellectual disabilities fare the worst economically among all persons with disabilities. In 2018, the average personal annual income for people with intellectual disabilities was CNY 11,388.3, roughly 70% of the income of people with physical disabilities, the highest income group. Their average salary income was a mere CNY 1,600.4 per year, lowest among all persons with disabilities, indicating their lack of access to formal employment opportunities. 178 In consultation, parents are the primary caregivers of persons with intellectual disabilities. They lack support from the government and alternative options for caregiving, and are concerned about the absence of affordable, high-quality care as they reach older age or pass away. \nFor people with psychosocial disabilities, an early analysis based on the 2006 disability sample survey data found that “ psychiatric disability, ” as defined by Chinese law, was significantly correlated with poverty. 179 Expert informants are concerned that institutional paternalism and stigma has led to substituted decisionmaking instead of supported decision making that respects the person ’s autonomy, lack of recognition of legal capacity, and restricted social participation of persons with psychosocial disabilities. Although China ’s Mental Health Law stipulates the right to litigation and the principle of voluntary diagnosis and hospitalization, in judicial practices, persons with psychosocial disabilities still lack decision-making power and court decisions continue to emphasize the role of legal guardians and family members. 180 The scarcity of high-quality community-based services is also a reality. \nDuring the latest review, the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities raised concerns about the use of coercive measures to institutionalize persons with intellectual and/or psychosocial disabilities, such as shackling, chaining, and medical restraints in China. 181 Reports have also been made about practices that restrict the reproductive rights of persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities, such as forced sterilization, abortion, castration and contraception. 182 Early in 2022, video of a chained woman, mother of eight children in a village in East China, led to public outcry about the violence and abuse against women with psychosocial disabilities in rural China, 183 who are particularly vulnerable to gender-based violence, including domestic violence, forced marriage, and trafficking. 7.3 Gender equality Women with disabilities face disproportionate, multiple discrimination caused by the intersection of gender, disability, and class. 184 An early study (2001-2010) funded by the State Council Committee on Women and Children ’s Work and CDPF shows that in 2010, 55.3% of women with disabilities never received any education, 27.9 percentage points higher than men with disabilities. A mere 26.4% of women with disabilities were employed, 12.4 percentage points lower than men with disabilities. In 2010, the average annual income of women with disabilities was CNY 3,501, making up only 44.1% of total women ’s income, and 85.9% of the income of men with disabilities. The situation is worse in rural areas. Among rural women with disabilities, only 4.3% of received education above high school level, and 33.7% were illiterate. For rural women with disabilities, their average annual income was CNY 1,173, less than one third of urban women with disabilities, and roughly half of them were entirely financially dependent on family members. Rural women with disabilities also reported higher incidents of domestic violence (20.7%) than women with disabilities in general (19.1%). 185 A 2015 baseline study jointly conducted by Sichuan University, a local DPF, and a women ’s federation, found that among the 113 government officials (city, district, county, and village level) they surveyed, most did not think women with disabilities face more discrimination, and 88.5% believed that gender-specific services were not necessary. Only 3-5% of officials had exposure to SOGI related trainings, and 35.4% received trainings on disability rights protection. 186 A decade later, women with disabilities face continued barriers in care, marriage and social life, reproductive health care, and equal opportunities to employment, as shown in a women ’s OPD survey of 535 women with disabilities. 187 Another recent multi-year OPD survey of 1,083 women with disabilities reveals that as high as 33% of them were once told to discontinue their education. Among educated informants, 24% experienced dropout because of their disability. 54.3% of women studied were not employed, for whom caretaking responsibilities and unsuccessful job seeking are the main reasons. Over half of the women reported experiences of rejection for job opportunities because of their disability, and 34.4% because of their gender. Most working women, on the other hand, received no support on workplace accessibility and reasonable accommodation, and 44.7% of them did not receive equal pay for equal work. Over half of the informants reported personal income as lower than CNY 2000 per month. 36.3% of women surveyed in 2020 experienced loss of income due to COVID-19. 188 \nIn 2020, the CDPF, supported by UN ESCAP, UN Women, UNFPA, and Rehabilitation International, released a “ Call to Action: Enabling Sisters with Disabilities to Join in Shaping the Future We Want ” in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action at the Fourth World Conference on Women, and the fifth year of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Promoting adequate standard of living, health, and education of women and girls with disabilities are among the top of the list of call for actions. Sexual and reproductive health is considered a key entry point of intervention for women and LGBTI persons with disabilities by consulted stakeholders, which, in the context of China, connects cross-cutting issues of healthcare, education, employment, accessibility, anti-violence, and rights awareness raising for persons with disabilities. 8. Disability Inclusion in Broader Development, Humanitarian & Emergency Contexts \n8.1 National Development Plans In China ’s National Plan on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 189 disability was explicitly mentioned in China ’s action plan for goal 4 (quality education), 8 (decent work and economic growth), and 10 (reduced inequalities). Specifically, China ’s actions plans with explicit reference to disability include: \n\n• SDG 4.2: Improve the funding system for preschool education to help the less-privileged, such as children from needy families, orphans and children with disabilities, to gain access to public preschool education. Improve the quality of kindergarten teachers \n\n• SDG 4.5: Protect everyone ’s right including that of vulnerable groups to education, and improve special education. Open special education schools in counties with more than 300,000 residents and gradually ensure 12-year free education for children with disabilities, covering the 9-year compulsory education and the senior high school education. \n\n• SDG 8.5: Increase labor force participation rate through implementation of the classification policy. Vigorously enforce the Law on Promotion of Employment. Targeted measures have been formulated to promote employment of university graduates, migrant workers, people with disabilities, retired soldiers, women and some other groups. Improve employment and entrepreneurship services and launch a lifelong vocational training initiative. \n\n• SDG 8.10: Implement the Plan for Promoting the Development of Financial Inclusion(2016-2020) to establish, by 2020, an inclusive financial services and security system to increase the accessibility of timely, affordable, and convenient financial services for the general public, especially for small and micro enterprises, farmers, urban low-incomers, poor people, people with disabilities and the elderly. By 2020, establish a modern insurance industry that is comprehensive, stable, well-functioning and credible. \n\n• SDG 10.3: Establish a more equitable and sustainable social protection system that better protect rights and interests of vulnerable social groups such as women, minors, and people with disabilities. \nIn China ’s Progress Report on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2021), persons with disabilities were reported as beneficiaries of China ’s progress on SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG4 (quality education), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). 190 In China ’s 2021 Voluntary National Review, people with disabilities are mentioned as beneficiaries of China ’s efforts in SDG 1.5, the world ’s largest social security system, and COVID response. No specific evidence was provided regarding the implementation of the disability-related goals listed in China ’s Action Plan. 191 There is no reference to OPD participation or capacity development support of OPDs in the Action Plan, Progress Report, or Voluntary National Review. \nThe UNSDCF (2021-2025) with China included disability-related support in “ Outcome 2: People ’s lives in China are improved further as headway is made in ensuring access to childcare, education, healthcare services, elderly care, housing, and social assistance, and more people in China, including left-behind groups, benefit from equitable and high-quality public services and social protection systems as well as accelerated efforts to reduce gender inequality and other forms of social inequality throughout the lifecourse. ” 192 The UNTGD is fully consulted in the country plans and strategies, processes and reporting. Other bilateral agencies and donors promote and engage in disability rights through their participation in the UNTGD meetings and activities, but most from disability-specific rather than disability mainstreaming perspectives. 8.2 Disaster risk reduction & humanitarian action Disability perspective has not been mainstreamed into China ’s disaster risk reduction (DRR) system. China ’s current Emergency Response Law has no specific provisions regarding targeted protections for vulnerable populations, including children, elderly people, and people with disabilities. 193 Article 70 of the Law on Protecting Against and Mitigating Earthquake Disasters requires post-disaster reconstruction to coordinate with the construction of accessible facilities, but the Law does not make explicit reference to the protection of persons with disabilities. 194 \nChina does have a few disability-specific policy directives that included DRR concerns. For instance, the Opinion on Strengthening Social Assistance for Persons with Disabilities, issued by CDPF in 2015, called for meeting the basic needs of persons with disabilities affected by disasters. 195 China ’s regulations and national plans on “ disability prevention ” also set the reduction of disaster-induced disabilities as targets. As a result, the disability-related tasks assigned to China ’s Ministry of Emergency Management is more aimed at preventing disability, less so at providing disability-inclusive services. 196 As COVID-19 heightened the lack of disability-inclusivity in China ’s emergency response system, Zhang Haidi, Chairwoman of CDPF, in her capacity as the Standing Committee Member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, raised policy recommendations that DRR related laws and policies should specify the protection of persons with disabilities and include accessibility, emergency information and DRR facilities should be made accessible, and the capacity of DRR service providers in protecting persons with disabilities should be strengthened. 197 Article 34 of China ’s Civil Code stipulates temporary caregiving services for people whose legal guardians are unavailable during emergencies. This is regarded as an advocacy success by OPDs, triggered by the tragic death of a 16-yearold teenager with cerebral palsy, a week after he was left unattended due to caregivers being taken to COVID-19 quarantine in early 2020. 198 In general, OPDs are not regularly consulted within the civil protection system or humanitarian system in planning and implementation of DRR/humanitarian efforts. 8.3 Climate Change The 2020 China Report of the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change pointed out disproportionate health risks posed by climate change on those living in poverty, with social disadvantages, and older people ( ≥65 years old). For instance, people above 65 years old face a 10.4% higher risk of dying in a heatwave, the mortality of which has risen by a factor of four from 1990 to 2019. 199 Demographically, these groups significantly overlap with China ’s persons with disabilities. \nDespite the urgency, persons with disabilities or OPDs are in general not included in climate change analyses, plans and programmes in China. In turn, OPDs and disability CSOs do not generally work on climate change issues. Occasionally, OPDs have mobilized and provided targeted community support during climate change related emergencies. For instance, when a severe flooding hit Henan Province in 2021, deaf persons led organization Know Deaf published guidelines for effectively rescuing people with 31726277.html \ndifferent kinds of disabilities during floods. 200 Systemic coordination between climate change and disability programs is lacking. 8.4 COVID-19 The Law on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, which is the legal basis for China ’s COVID policies, is criticized for lacking a disability lens and overlooks the needs of persons with disabilities in terms of access to information, basic goods and services, medications and assistive devices, and care. 201 In 2020, the CDPF issued a Guideline on the Protection of Disabled Persons in Severe Infectious Disease Epidemics, which mainly provides generic guidance for self-protection. 202 \nIn 2021, Raoul Wallenberg Institute of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law conducted a participatory action research with the OPD Minority Voices, offering the first comprehensive study of COVID-19 experiences of persons with disabilities. According to the report, persons with disabilities have experienced disruptions of access to regular healthcare, community living, employment, and education during lockdowns. Top unmet needs include purchasing medical supplies, worsened mental health, paused access to delivery services, sense of isolation, lack of financial relief, loss of livelihood, lack of remote learning support, and inaccessibility of remote learning tools. 203 In response, OPDs, volunteer groups, and individuals with disabilities have actively participated in community-level mutual assistance, and disability-inclusive advocacy. For instance, in early 2020, deaf persons ’ organization ProSigner, based in Wuhan, organized to support local deaf communities to access accurate public health information and distributing medical supplies such as masks, disinfectants, and gloves. 204 A network of volunteers from across the country organized to support people with disabilities in coordination with local CSOs, providing information, shopping, counselling, and resource referral services. Inclusion China launched a mutual assistance network among families of people with intellectual disabilities. Multiple OPDs/CSOs such as One Plus One, Able Development Institute, Voices of the Disabled, and the Disability COVID Support Volunteer Network, drafted specific handbooks and guidelines regarding the science of COVID, self-protection measures, response to domestic violence during quarantine, and accessible emergency response and service provision. Women ’s OPD BEST organized donations of sanitary care products for women with disabilities. 205 \nhttps://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/C_GmGMiqGQI3teh9QK_JtQ This section focuses on the overall key challenges in systems, structures, practices, and capacities and discusses the underlying causes. Specific gaps under each area of inquiry will not be repeated here. Analysis of key gaps and opportunities \nGaps Equality and non-discrimination: Attitudinal barriers are considered by stakeholders as one of the most fundamental challenges that cuts across all preconditions for inclusion. Progress has been made since the adoption of CRPD in 2008 in terms of awareness-raising of the social model of disability, especially among development partners and OPDs/CSOs. Yet the Chinese society at large and its corresponding systems are predominantly taking a medical model approach to disability, regarding persons with disabilities as subjects of charity and welfare in need of special rather than mainstream services. Policy makers and service providers, especially at grassroots levels, lack the awareness and buy-in of CRPD or the social model of disability. Laws and regulations relevant to disability are not fully aligned with the CRPD, and lack strength in enforcement and remedies. \nInclusive Service Delivery: The current policy frameworks tend to regard persons with disabilities as welfare beneficiaries more than rights holders. Public provision of disability support services prioritize social protection, subsidies, and rehabilitation, less focused on building support systems for the equal participation of persons with disabilities in society, such as inclusive education and employment. Policy makers are incentivized to maximize service coverage for the large population of persons with disabilities with limited resources, de-emphasizing the quality of services. The agency and autonomy of persons with disabilities is downplayed. As reflected in multi-stakeholder consultations, OPDs are concerned about the policy focus on family ’s responsibility in caregiving for persons with disabilities, without sufficient government support. \nAccessibility: Unchecked discrimination against persons with disabilities, combined with the lack of reasonable accommodations and accessibility, pose consistent barriers in all aspects of social participation of persons with disabilities. Despite increased government investment in accessibility, weak enforcement, insufficient remedies, and the lack of meaningful participation of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessible tools and standards has resulted in the poor quality of accessibility measures. As shown in the draft Law on the Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, there is also a tendency to prioritize physical environment over access to information and service provision, especially for persons with intellectual or psychosocial impairments, and deaf people/persons with hearing impairments. \nAccountability and Governance: Disability has not yet been mainstreamed into the current governance structure. The CDPF system is assigned the responsibility for disability inclusion but with insufficient authority to coordinate with other ministries. This relatively segregated coordination mechanism within the government, according to stakeholders consulted, can form barriers for OPDs to engage mainstream ministries and obtain resources from the government which are concentrated within the DPF system. Consistent data collections on disability inclusion aligned with the CRPD and SDGs are lacking. Official statistics on disability adopt impairment-based definitions of disability and does not comply with the ICF or CRPD definitions of disability. Further, stakeholders are concerned about the reliability of self-reported data, the transparency of data, and the lack of disaggregated data by disability in mainstream data collections. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: Despite the much larger size compared to development partners, government budgeting prioritizes welfare provision over rights protection, and special rather than mainstream services. Significant power and resource imbalances exist between the duty bearers and rights holders. While development partners are reducing support for countries like China as its income level grows, development programs funded by foreign entities are under increasing legal and administrative scrutiny. This has impacted the development of independent OPDs which lack access to government resources. Participation: OPDs independent from the government lack the opportunity to participate meaningfully in policy and decision making. Formal mechanisms for OPD participation prefer state-affiliated, serviceoriented organizations/individuals. Many independent OPDs operate as unregistered, self-help groups run by volunteers, in the absence of sufficient financial and human resources for professionalization. Compared to other CSOs, leaders with disabilities have lower social capital due to systemic exclusion in education, community participation, and other critical life opportunities. While grassroots OPDs are often blamed for lacking the capacity to engage in policy making and development programs, mechanisms for engagement fail to consider these preexisting disadvantages and provide support systems to prioritize the voices of persons with disabilities, especially the most marginalized. Even at occasions for dialogues with policy makers, grassroots OPDs and leaders with disabilities experience significant power imbalances in the authority to speak about disability and access to resources, compared to experts, professionals, and decision-makers without disabilities. They see such engagement as “ unbalanced, insufficient, and unequal. ” \nInequalities and Gender: Persons with disabilities in rural areas, who constitute the majority of the disabled population in China, are still largely unreached by development programs. They face harsher living conditions, and more likelihood to acquire severe disabilities, but less access to healthcare, education, employment, and accessible environment. Due to the financial structure of local DPFs, which obtain funding from same-level government instead of the CDPF, areas that are less economically developed tend to have lower budget on disability, despite higher needs. Among these groups, women with disabilities and people with multiple disabilities are further disadvantaged. Yet existing government and development programs tend to consider gender and disability in isolation, resulting in the lack of gender awareness in disability inclusion programs and policies, and vice versa. Opportunities Having completed the poverty alleviation campaign in 2020, the government ’s ongoing priority is rural revitalization and achieving common prosperity, namely, reducing inequalities and income gaps between urban and rural areas. Persons with disabilities significantly overlap with China ’s most impoverished population. Increasing high-quality jobs is a key approach for economic empowerment, especially during China ’s post-COVID economic recovery. In 2022, the State Council adopted the Three-Year Action Plan on Promoting Disability Employment (2022-2024), setting the target of generating one million new jobs for persons with disabilities over three years, and encouraging the public sector to take the lead in hiring persons with disabilities. Changes in the private sector are also happening, such as the global push for more stakeholder-centric approach to doing business, including the Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) framework. More corporations begin to adopt disability inclusion in their ESG framework, providing an entry-point for disability-inclusive employment. As such, stakeholders of disability inclusion see opportunities in promoting decent work in government, big corporations, and rural areas. This can also pave the way for more meaningful participation in policy and decision making, as more persons with disabilities enter the public and private sector as employees. China ’s ageing population has made the provision of accessible environment and services ever more urgent. COVID-19 also heightened the issue of digital divide in China, making it pressing for improving the digital accessibility and digital literacy among persons with disabilities and elderly people. The new Law on the Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, passed on June 28, 2023, is indicative of the growing importance of accessibility in recent years, and creates a policy window for more awareness-raising on accessibility, including built environment, information and communication, and services. Although the second draft of the law is still criticized for having “ no teeth ” or remedies, its symbolic presence can boost the legitimacy of local OPDs ’ existing efforts in requesting access with public service providers (e.g. subway, banks, etc.). Government stakeholders also foresee needs for technical and publicity support on promoting the new legislation and specifying local-level enforcement measures. In addition, policies like the 2021 Special Action Plan on Elderly-oriented and Barrier-free Modifications for Internet Applications, the 2021 Action Plan on Improving National Digital Literacy and Skills, and China ’s entry into the Marrakesh Treaty, create incentives for more stakeholders to engage in accessibility. To take advantage of these developments, OPDs call for attention to the digital literacy divide caused by lack of access to digital tools or skills. \nChina ’s population policies have been undergoing transformations in recent years. Since 2021, couples in China are allowed to have three children with support measures. 206 In 2022, China witnessed its first population decline in 60 years. 207 While family planning policies continue to relax and policy incentives for child-rearing increase, the implications for persons with disabilities are unclear. On one hand, persons with disabilities lack equal access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) care; on the other hand, preventing disability remains a health target in national health strategies. 208 To maximize the benefits and minimize the harm of the increased investment in population growth and health management, the SRH needs of persons with disabilities warrant attention. Meanwhile, SRH offers an entry-point for persons with disabilities to address cross-cutting issues such as gender-based violence, education and health inequity, and the agency and autonomy of individuals with disabilities. \nA potential mechanism to expand OPD participation in decision-making is to take part in research that can serve as evidence for policy making. This is in line with the Communist Party ’s recent promotion for research and survey among Party members to better connect policy and practice. 209 Best practices include OPDs organizing community focus groups and partnering with scholars involved in policy making to submit proposals or policy opinions; combining short-term trainings with long-term regular research groups; and co-authoring independent surveys/study reports with subject matter experts. \nA gradual cultural shift is taking place from the medical model to the social model. More self-advocates with disabilities and new narratives are emerging in mainstream and social media, challenging stereotypes about disability. These circumstances present a crucial opportunity for the UN to leverage its influence, such as advocating for policy changes that align with the CRPD, building capacity and providing platforms for OPDs and individual advocates, and support the government, including CDPF and other ministries, in promoting inclusive services. Recommendations for UNCT action 1. To continue to raise awareness of the social model of disability among policy makers, service providers, and key decision-makers in all interactions between the UN and the stakeholders participating in the three prioritised UNPRPD programme areas; cultural and educational services, employment and SRHR. Previous UNPRPD programs have successfully engaged legal professionals, educators, media, and employers through disability mainstreaming trainings such as the Disability Equality Trainings (DET). Future programs should prioritize local DPFs and service providers, lawmakers, key ministries such as the National Health Commission, Ministry of Civil Affairs, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Culture and Tourism, Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and even Party institutions such as the Central Party School. Strengthen the role of OPDs and trainers/facilitators with disabilities in awareness raising programs. In addition to short-term training programs, design opportunities for longterm engagement, such as credit course in universities, or join participatory action research programs. \n2. To support the implementation of the newly passed Law on the Construction of Barrier-Free Environments and related policies by ¨ \na) Supporting selected local governments to develop concrete implementation plans (as models of good practice), with focus on culture, employment and SRHR. After the law comes into effect, local governments will develop local implementation guidelines, which can be an opportunity to specify and translate the principles of the law into more concrete requirements. Based on the law, the UN can facilitate government coordination at the local level, between the DPF, and departments of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, Civil Affairs, Industry and Information Technology, Transport, Culture and Tourism, Education, and Health Commissions. The UN can support the promotion of the content of the law among stakeholders, and the development of guidelines in specific areas, such as how OPDs and individuals can use the law to protect their own rights, and implement barrier-free and reasonable accommodation provisions in schools, workplaces, museums etc,. Programs should be sensitive to the urban-rural divide. \nb) Supporting technology cooperations, vocational education partners and OPDs to improve the accessibility of internet and digital tools and enhancing the skills for persons with disabilities to make use of digital tools with focus on education, employment, SRHR and advocacy. This will contribute to reducing the digital divide among persons with disabilities – especially marginalized groups such as person with intellectual disabilities and women with disabilities in rural areas. This will also promote the right to information and further implementation of the Marrakesh Treaty, the Special Action Plan on Elderly-oriented and Barrier-free Modifications for Internet Applications, and Action Plan on Improving National Digital Literacy and Skills. Consider leveraging ongoing policy support for vocational education in promoting information and digital literacy. 3. To support the implementation of the State Council Three-Year Action Plan on Promoting Disability Employment by providing support to the local partners of the GBDN-China network to develop guidance on disability inclusion for employers in the public/private sector. Use the momentum of the government ’s directives on strengthening vocational education to demonstrate how to include vocational trainings of persons with disabilities in programmes, with special focus on the urban-rural divide, leveraging the government ’s ongoing focus on rural revitalization. Previous development programs have focused on educating and supporting private sector employers, and concentrated in big corporations and cities. Building on the success, future programs can consider expanding these efforts to the public sector, companies with global supply chains, the digital economy, or remote areas. In the short term, OPDs and employment service providers can benefit from strengthening their expertise in employer engagement, job redesign, and employee support, and learning about concrete, best practices of disability-inclusive employment sensitive to local contexts, preferably disaggregated by impairment, degree of disability, and gender.. Programs should prioritize the leadership of OPDs,. \n4. To support improvements in accessibility and availability of disability inclusive SRHR information and services by developing, testing and putting to use materials, tools and communication methods that help to raise the awareness and capacity of OPDs on SRHR advocacy and the awareness and capacity of service providers to deliver better availability, accessibility, acceptance and quality of services. Use SRH as an entry point to enhance the mutual mainstreaming of disability and gender programs, and strengthen the safety, agency, life opportunities, and autonomy of women and girls with disabilities. \n5. To enhance coordination between stakeholders by strengthening UNCT partnerships with not only the DPFs but also other ministries, especially at the local level. Utilize the UN ’s convening power to engage ministries and departments, breaking the silos between DPFs, OPDs, and different government departments. Engage grassroots OPDs, local government departments and DPFs. This can help strengthen their coordination at the local levels, build support networks for local OPDs, and localize CRPD implementation in ways that account for local realities. The CDPF also conveyed some local DPFs ’ interests for international cooperation. \n6. To enhance the knowledge base of UNCT and national stakeholders on disability inclusion, in line with the CRPD to better understand gaps and opportunities. This will be used to inform future action. This analysis has identified a few areas that need further research by the UNCT, including: \n• The development of independent OPDs across China, especially in smaller cities/rural areas \n\n• Effectiveness of formal and informal participation mechanisms for state and non-state affiliated OPDs \n\n• The economic impact of inclusive education and employment of persons with disabilities on individual, family and community economy \n\n• The collection of general mainstream data, disaggregated by disability, including impairment type, degree, location, and gender. 7. To establish meaningful mechanisms to enhance OPD participation and amplify the voices of persons with disabilities in UN supported programmes. For instance, within the UNPRPD program, pilot test a mechanism for OPDs to partner with scholars/CSOs/think tanks/associations on evidence-based policy advocacy. The latter stakeholders can function as intermediaries between grassroots OPDs and policy makers. The collaboration mechanism should combine OPDs ’ disability-specific expertise, with the allies ’ domain-specific expertise and government access (e.g. education, health/SRHR, employment, or accessibility), and produce joint products for policy advocacy (e.g. reports, policy proposals, internal briefings, or pilot programs). The mechanism should fully leverage OPDs ’ leadership and expertise in analyzing community needs, while strengthening OPDs ’ policy advocacy skills and local-level support networks. It should also serve to increase the disability inclusion awareness and capabilities of domain experts. OPDs shall play a leading role in the mechanism, with sufficient decision-making power at each stage of the project, rather than mere data collectors. The UN should aim for creating opportunities for de-bureaucratized, informal engagement among stakeholders. \n8. To strengthen the resources and capacity for grassroots OPDs to participate in policy making, implementation, and monitoring in UN funded programmes. This could serve as models of good practice for other local programmes. Leverage the UNPRPD program and platforms such as the UNTGD, to facilitate regular knowledge exchanges among OPDs and stakeholders on successful engagement with existing participation mechanisms. These can include best practices of partnering with governmenttrusted think tanks for policy advocacy, submitting proposals to the NPC and CPPCC sessions, engagement strategies with government entities, campaigns for mobilizing public comments on draft legislations, monitoring the implementation of accessibility standards, participation in UN human rights treaty mechanisms, and effective collaboration with the private sector. The UN should provide a safe space and allocate sufficient resources to ensure OPDs and individuals with disabilities with less access can benefit. \n9. To create platforms for capacity building and international exchange for grassroots OPDs. Although development funding is negligible compared to the scale of government budget on disability, resources for OPDs remain scarce. OPDs operating in similar social and economic contexts can share ideas and build peer-support networks. It can also increase the visibility of Chinese OPDs at the international level and share Chinese best practices with other countries. \n10. To prioritize women with disabilities and marginalized communities in the design of the PRPD program. Prioritize the leadership of women with disabilities in development programs, and support gender-sensitive approaches to disability programs, rather than merely including female participants in activities. Allocate sufficient financial and human resources to support the meaningful participation of marginalized communities, such as travel, lodging, personal assistance, and reasonable accommodations. \n11. To enhance disability and gender mutual mainstreaming within the UN system. The 2022 Disability Inclusion Scorecard Assessment shows that the UNCT still fall short in meeting Indicator 8 “ Joint programmes: Joint programmes contribute to disability inclusion ” and Indicator 9 “ Data: Strengthening data on persons with disabilities. ” OPDs expect the UN to further implement the United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy, and model best practices such as incorporating disability components, indicators, and OPDs in non-disability focused UN programs, employing persons with disabilities, enhancing the accessibility of UN offices and meetings, and increasing the collection and disclosure of data disaggregated by types of disability, degrees of disability, and location of persons with disabilities. \nwww.UNPRPD.org "

\n截至2021年12月底，心智障碍者家庭支持计划覆盖25个市县，服务了53168人次心智障碍者和49918人次家长，并入选界面新闻“ 2021年度杰出慈善案例榜单” 。通过《家庭满意度调查问卷》显示： 95%以上的家长表示，资源中心的存在可减轻孤立无援的感觉，对子女有更加多元和深入的了解，可提升面对子女问题的能力，增加寻找解决问题的方法和资源。 \n本套《心智障碍者家庭资源手册》围绕“信息提供”这一资源中心最为基础的功能，系统筛选梳理了相关信息，期望能为迷茫期的心智障碍者家长，心智障碍者及家庭的服务提供者，以及任何希望了解和支持心智障碍者的相关方提供信息参考。 前言庭是每个人获得支持的最小社会单元。对于心智障碍者而言， \n\n他们的照料者是终生的陪伴者和支持者，只有有效地支持到家庭成员，才能够更好地促进从家庭到心智障碍者生活质量的提升。由中国精神残疾人及亲友协会编著的《中国孤独症家庭需求蓝皮书》显示： 95%的家长认为急需专业咨询及政策信息需求， 79.1%的家长认为在孩子的康复教育等方面没有获得专业化系统培训。 基于此背景，晓更基金会希望能通过这套资源手册，将有关心智障碍者的一些基本理念、知识、信息、建议等内容进行基础性的提炼汇总，各地心智障碍者家长组织或服务机构可以在本手册基础上，结合本地有关政策、服务资源、养育经验等内容进一步补充丰富，从而更好地帮助当地心智障碍者链接或获得专门化服务、主流化服务(如基本的健康、教育、就业等)以及获得主流化服务所需的辅助性服务或支持(如社区支持、家庭教育等) 。 北京市晓更助残基金会常务副秘书长\n\n梁志图机在是2023年，距离壹基金创始人李连杰先生参演的电影《海洋\n\n天堂》上映过去了13年，距离壹基金发起海洋天堂计划过去了11年。这个公益项目从关注孤独症群体到更大的心智障碍者人群，由“我”到“我们” ，从个人需求转化为公共议题，我们也一起见证了心智障碍者家长、家长组织、家长网络的成长和良性发展。我们同全国家长们一起从服务特殊需要人群，到组织和骨干能力建设，再到政策促进，以及公众环境教育。 从一生需求出发， 2019年6月，深圳壹基金公益基金会和水滴公司旗下水滴公益平台共同发起心智障碍者家庭支持计划，聚焦城市及欠发达地区支持心智障碍者家庭资源中心和家长联络站的建设，以街道、社区为单位，为各地心智障碍者及其家庭照料者开展信息提供、同伴支持、家长赋能、个性化支持和社区合作等服务，希望可以改善家长们孤立无援的处境，帮助家长们增强解决子女问题的方法和能力。 《心智障碍者家庭资源手册》属于该项目的一部分，期望能为迷茫期的您提供信息参考。 \n深圳壹基金公益基金会联合公益部主任\n任少鹏家庭和居住社区系统14家庭支持\n\n社区参与录01 \n04 \n政策福利系统51教育类政策法规\n\n福利保障类政策法规\n02 03 \n医疗健康系统22诊断评估\n\n机构康复\n05 附录57

、建立期(约相当于成人前期) 、维持期(约相当于中年期)以及衰退期(约相当于老年期) 。 纵向代表纵贯上下的生活空间,由人一生中必须扮演的九种主要身份角色组成，依次是：儿童、学生、休闲者、公民、工作者、夫妻、父母和退休者。各种角色之间是相互作用的，一个角色的成功，特别是早期的角色如果发展得较好，将会为其他角色提供良好的关系基础。但是，在一个角色上投入过多的精力，而没有平衡协调各角色的关系，则会导致其他角色的失败。在每一个阶段对每一个角色投入的程度用颜色来表示,颜色面积越多表示该角色投入的程度越多。 \n\"生涯彩虹图”符合一般人的普遍情况，虽然年龄段与角色的对应随着时代发展或个人情况会有些许变化，但大体与图示相符。根据国际残障领域专家研究发现，心智障碍者在成年之前与一般人的发展阶段和扮演角色基本一致，但在成年中期后，差异逐渐显著，他们的衰退期可能比一般人早20年。 \n此图由内向外所示，以心智障碍者为中心，围绕他/她们的环境中可分为四类系统：家庭和社区系统、教育/社会系统、政策福利系统和医疗健康系统。根据“生涯彩虹图” ，对应这四个系统，心智障碍者在这个年龄段会扮演不同的身份角色。最外圈则是心智障碍者为扮演好每个身份角色，所需要的支持资源。本手册内容框架正是以这四个系统及对应的支持资源来展。 \n01 家庭和居住社区系统0-3岁的心智障碍者需求安全感的建立任何一名婴儿在这个年龄段都需要建立安全感，建立与母亲的依恋关系，他们最需要的首先是来自家庭的照顾和支持，即使他们伴有某种障碍，专业支持也绝对不能替代家庭支持。 家庭照护者做好心理调适此时的照护者主要是父母，如果因为发现孩子有些不同，从而承受了很大的心理压力，则需要向家人坦诚表达自身的焦虑、痛苦等情绪和感受，给自己一些时间作为缓冲期，调适自己的心理状态。 \n如果长期处于焦虑或抑郁状态，无法自行调整和复原，建议主动寻求外部支持，例如找心理咨询师辅导，或与其他有经验的家长交流等。 家庭内部的充分沟通和准备父母之间首先要达成共识,掌握照顾和支持孩子的技能，学习通用育儿知识和针对自己孩子情况的特殊照护方法。 \n养育一名有心智障碍的孩子，有时不仅仅是一个小家庭的事，父母需要让家族亲人了解并适应孩子的情况,商量关于照料孩子的合理分工,争取家族的理解和支持。家庭需要为孩子诊断及后续干预所需的费用做好准备，量力而行。 \n4-6岁的心智障碍者需求建立自信心，在家庭的支持下学习基本生活技能这个阶段的幼儿需要得到爱、认可、尊重和信任，优点能够被看见和肯定，而不是只被关注到障碍和弱点。 \n\n获得来自家庭的教育和引导，个人良好的行为习惯能够得到培养(如:遵守规则、情绪稳定等) \n\n学习基本生活自理技能,例如独立吃饭、如厕、穿脱衣服等,为就读幼儿园和小学做准备；从小养成良好的口腔卫生习惯。 \n\n接受家庭内提供的学龄前儿童性教育,认识身体的隐私、了解如何保护自己、学习恰当的社交礼仪等，有助于在幼儿园、小学、社区的融合。 照护者提升支持孩子的能力学习教养孩子的理念和技巧，处理和应对孩子出现的情绪问题或不恰当行为等。也要了解处理家庭成员之间因教育和康复理念不同而引发矛盾和冲突的解决方案。 \n照护者需要找到方法来缓解自己的精神和心理压力，并应对孩子康复、照顾等方面带来的经济压力。 \n学习支持孩子的相关知识，例如国家教育部《 3-6岁儿童学习与发展指南》 ，此外还可以从正规网站、机构公众号、家长组织交流中获得有用的信息。 \n照护者建立自身的支持网络，通过和家人、朋友、其他家长的坦诚沟通，建立自身的支持网络,例如社交圈子、互助小组等,可以参加家长组织举办的相关小组(如：学龄前孩子家长的互助小组) ，如果当地没有家长组织，也可搜索周边其他城市家长组织/互助小组的公众号等线上渠道，获取信息。 \n早期干预中的家庭教育1 \n接纳孩子、共情孩子一个伴有心智障碍的儿童,从小会承受比一般同龄孩子更多更大的挑战和压力。所以在接受干预之前,他们首先需要:被父母接纳、获得安全感和自信，而非沉浸在父母的焦虑和愧疚之中；被父母理解、共情，所有情绪背后的原因能够被看见，而非以爱之名被过度要求或过度溺爱。 照护者需要了解康复的基本方法和原理了解这些知识和信息，一方面帮助照护者为心智障碍子女选择机构，另一方面能够学习到一些可以在家中进行的康复和教育技能。 全家人的教育理念要一致如果父母双方教育理念相互矛盾,比如父母一方严格教育,而另一方却打退堂鼓,就不可能有效地教育子女。家庭成员内部要达成一致,子女的教养问题以其中一方为主，其他家人配合，并尽可能为主要照顾者提供情绪方面的支持和理解。 \n4 结合日常生活情境，进行能力培养和常识教育好的教育不受时间或场地限制,如社会交往规则、认路、辨别方向、认识周围事物等,完全可以在日常生活情境中完成,不必刻意安排时间或模拟场景。 父母需要有足够的耐儿尤其在生活自理方面，有些父母因屡次教不会就产生不耐烦的情绪，干脆代替孩子来做，这样非常不利于孩子的成长进步，请父母一定要理解孩子的处境和困难，他们不是不努力，也不是故意学不会，只是需要的时间久一点，练习的次数多一点。 温柔地坚持，看到孩子的进步生活中多关注孩子的进步和正向行为，及时给予具体鼓励(描述孩子的好行为或者他的心情) ，不要给类似“你真棒”的表扬。在孩子出现不恰当行为时，父母要不带情绪，坚持正确的要求，直至期待行为出现，并及时给予孩子具体鼓励。 培养孩子的生活自理能力如独立吃饭、如厕、穿衣等能力,将对孩子的日常生活、入读幼儿园/学校、进行৪ \n培养孩子的沟通和社交能力父母需要提供给心智障碍孩子自我表达的机会，耐心倾听并给予鼓励，尤其需要教给孩子社交规则，因为一个守规则、有礼貌的人,会比一个仅仅会识字算数的人，更容易融入社会、容易获得他人的接纳和欢迎。 \nو \n必要时,可使用辅助交流手段\n\n对于语言障碍程度高的心智障碍者,使用手语或图片(沟通卡)等其他辅助手段作为交流符号，可以让他们更有信心参与沟通和社交，并且保持积极乐观的态度。 \n10 \n\n注重孩子时间观念的培养\n\n让心智障碍孩子从小学会安排自己的时间，有更多自我掌控感。 \n培养孩子的主动性，并今早发现孩子的潜能\n\n给孩子选择权，尊重孩子的意愿及兴趣。及早尝试并发掘孩子的兴趣爱好，以便未来丰富他们的休闲生活以及明确择业方向。 \n社会交往等未来重要的人生经历有至关重要的作用，这甚至比学习文化知识更为重要，因为生活自理才是进入幼儿园/学校的门槛。 \n一定要让孩子有足够的体育锻炼\n\n因为体育锻炼是最安全且能有效缓解孩子的情绪问题、增强身心健康的方法。 \nn 为什么要参与社区\n任何年龄段都需要社区融合童、青少年需要伙伴和友谊,成年人需要丰富的社会生活，避免一直待在家中导致各方面能力提早退化。支持心智障碍者走向社会，融入社区，有助于提高他们的社会生活能力，更好地在社会中生存。 社区的优势社区是一个很好的天然教学场所，孩子可以在父母的引导下、在真实情境中去应用和实践平时学习到的各种技能。 “父母先走出来，孩子才有未来” 融合首先需要父母打开心结，不刻意对身边人隐瞒孩子的情况，心智障碍孩子的未来，取决于父母是否真正接纳这个孩子。从另一个角度说，一些父母的痛苦根源并不是一个有心智障碍的孩子,而能否真正接纳。 如何参与社区\n适应社区首先要走出家门,了解并使用社区的资源和各种公共设施设备，从附近的小商店、理发店、健身房等场所开始，让心智障碍者可以逐步适应环境，拓展其生活经验，当他们熟悉了社区环境，就会慢慢放松下来，自然地融入社区。 参与并贡献社区寻找其他社区参与的机会，如：家长组织举办的融合活动、社区向居民开放的各类休闲和体育活动等;照护者也可以带孩子一起贡献社区，例如担任垃圾分类等社区事务志愿者等。 社区内部倡导，建构社区支持资源网络在社区内为心智障碍者搭建一个良好的融合环境— —让社区内常接触的左邻右舍、保洁保安都了解到孩子的情况，在有需要的时候，坦诚地告诉别人可以如何支持这个孩子，让社区里的人“看着孩子长大” ，他们会通过自己的观察、相处的经历去了解、理解和接纳这样的孩子，逐渐成为自然支持资源。 02 \n医疗健康系统照护者需要\n了解孩子的障碍类型及特点\n心智障碍包括不同障碍类型，每个人的情况也各不相同。父母需要同时结合孩子的年龄发展阶段以及不同障碍类型的特点，有针对性地为孩子提供所需的支持。 \n\n建议照护者补充阅读《家长支持资源中心手册障别系列》中与孩子情况相符的内容，其中包括《发育迟缓(智力障碍) 》 《孤独症》 《唐氏综合征》和《脑瘫》 4个分册，以便详细了解您孩子所伴有的障碍具备哪些特质、会遇到哪些挑战以及养育/教育中的注意事项等。 \n《发育迟缓》 / 《孤独症》 诊断之后做什么确诊之后,照护者可能第一时间想到孩子应该得到什么“治疗” 。通常情况下，心智障碍者需要接受“早期干预”来帮助改善残障对他们的影响，这个时候对照护者的“考验”才真的到来— —树立正确的观念、学习科学的方法、注重常态化的养育/教育、然后持之以恒。 了解早期干预的四个方面早期干预不是只有机构康复这一项，而是有四个重要方面，即:家庭教育、机构康复、幼儿园/校园融合与社区融合。其中家庭教育排在首位，这一点很容易被众多照护者所忽略。 所谓“密集干预” 很多照护者在孩子被确诊时，也许听过一个名词叫“密集干预” ，例如国外有学者提到，孤独症儿童要接受每周不低于40个小时的干预。这会让一些照顾者感到很焦虑，担心如果没有接受到足够量的密集干预，就会耽误孩子后期康复的效果；也有的照护者会抱着通过密集康复训练来治愈孩子的功能性障碍的不理性期望，认为只有让心智障碍儿童先在机构中接受高强度训练，尤其是通过机构内一对一桌面密集干预来提升能力，才能开始考虑教育问题。所以我们就会看到，很多孩子不是在康复，就是在康复的路上，严重压缩了在儿童早期发展中十分重要的游戏与真实生活时间。 重新理解“密集干预” ：看待儿童的成长发展需要更全面的视角，而非只关注所谓的“缺陷” 、 “问题”和“障碍” 。心智障碍儿童的早期干预需要接受多元刺激，所谓密集干预不等同于机构康复，更不等同于在桌面进行的康复，除了机构专门的康复训练，心智障碍儿童的早期干预还应该同时在家庭、社区、幼儿园等这些自然环境当中提供,让儿童所处的所有环境、所经历的方方面面,都嵌入着自然情境教学、随机教学，让干预的机会分布在儿童生活的时时刻刻，这样才能真正达到密集的要求，而自然环境中的干预对于特殊幼儿能力的维持、泛化与整合非常重要。 (赵梅菊， 2022)换句话说， “密集干预”是在自然环境中密集提供干预的机会，而不是单纯时间、地点和强度的密集。 \n“密集干预” 心智障碍会伴随终身，照护者需要在孩子小的时候就对全生命周期的发展有基本的预期，并作长远的打算。及时、科学的早期干预和教育，对心智障碍者各方面的成长和发展有关键影响。 (关于全生命周期发展，请详见《家长支持资源中心手册总册》 ) 是在自然环境中密集提供干预的机会，而不是单纯时间、地点和强度的密集。 \n机构康复。 \n为何要寻找康复机构\n科学干预，长远打算\n持续进行阶段性评估照护者可以通过当地心智障碍者家长群、康复机构公众号、当地残疾人联合会网站等渠道，尽可能多地了解本地康复机构的信息，为孩子选择正规的、可信的、适合的机构进行早期干预。 \n找一名专业的治疗师为孩子进行评估，并能在不同阶段聆听、分析和给予专业的支持，尤其是孤独症儿童，首次评估后每隔3-5年为孩子再次作评估，根据孩子最新的发展需求，及时调整支持方案。 如何寻找适合的康复机构\n康复机构现状需求多,机构少\n据2006年《第二次全国残疾人抽样调查主要数据公报》统计推算， 0-6岁残疾儿童约141万人。与此同时, 《 2020年残疾人事业发展统计公报》显示, 0-6岁残疾儿童中有23.7万人得到基本康复服务，从数字统计看，目前康复干预服务的可及性还存在一定的缺口。 \n全国0-6岁残疾儿童人数全国0-6岁残疾儿童中得到基本康复服务人数\n2018年6月,国务院印发《关于建立残疾儿童康复救助制度的意见》 ,決定自2018年10月1日起全民实施残疾儿童康复救助制度。救助对象为0-6岁视力、听力、言语、肢体、智力等残疾儿童和孤独症儿童，年度康复补贴额从1.2万元到2.4万元不等，各个地区根据地方政策而定。 2019年,中国残联开发启用全国残疾儿童康复救助信息管理平台,为残疾儿童父母网上申请康复救助提供条件,汇总公布3200家残障儿童康复救助经办机构和5100家儿童康复救助定点机构信息。根据我们的观察，康复机构以民办非营利社会组织为主，也有工商注册的企业运营，有些取得教育部门的教育机构资质，有些取得医疗资质，目前没有清晰的统计。近年来，学龄前康复机构发展加快，数量有上升趋势，但是服务品质良莠不齐，服务机构专职人员的资质及受训情况缺乏系统的监督保障。 康复机构的特点大多服务2-6岁。我国90%的康复机构服务对象为2-6岁心智障碍儿童，而2岁前的幼儿更需要家庭本位的支持。 ¥100 \n看兜里有多少钱量力而行。不提倡砸锅卖铁去康复，目前大多数小龄康复机构每月的收费至少要3000元以上,个别达到上万元。父母要冷静衡量,首先心智障碍者的康复教育不是短期的，不是撑一两年就可以，所以要考虑自己家庭的实际情况，然后再决定选择什么样的模式和方法。 \n双收入最好。普通家庭,夫妻双方都能保持工作、有收入是最好，父母一方完全辞职、照顾孩子，压力反而更大。 \n能拿的补贴一定要拿。要去残联网站查找康复政策， 16岁以下儿童凭医院诊断证明或残疾人证，到残联定点康复机构接受康复治疗，可享受每人每年一定额度的康复补贴(各地方补贴标准不同,具体请参考本地残疾儿童康复补贴政策) 。 \n就近原则。父母需避免远距离接送孩子康复而耽误工作。 \n异地康复要做好充分准备。去异地康复，除了康复费用之外，还需要支出在异地的居住、生活和往返交通费，如果因为经济压力最终无法坚持、半途而废，对孩子和家庭都是非常大的消耗。有些家庭还有其他孩子或老人需要照顾，所以需要平衡考虑家人共同协商之后再决定。如果一定要到异地机构去康复，家长要做好经济、精力投入和家庭分工的充分准备。 看机构好不好货比三家不吃亏。大城市里很多康复机构实力差不多，多去几家机构看看，考察一番。如果康复机构里的训练绝大多数是桌面回合,要慎选,尽可能寻找以实物教学及游戏活动为主要训练形式的机构。 \n勿轻信“疗效”广告，勿轻信网络搜索出来的口碑。越宣传自己机构疗效好，越要谨慎，凡事讲证据，如果某机构号称有治愈、 “摘帽”的案例，父母一定先去考察这种案例有多少,具体什么情况,最好能亲眼见一见。请各位父母时刻提醒自己：孩子的障碍会伴随终身，治愈几乎是不可能的，不要被某些机构欺骗，导致人财两空。 \n没有最好，只有最适合。机构康复的体验和效果因人而异，根据心智障碍儿童不同年龄、不同状态，会产生不一样的口碑，因此建议先把孩子送去试读几个月。没有最好的机构，只有最适合孩子的机构。 \n康复情况对父母透明。一般正规康复机构(无论是不是残联定点机构) ，都很重视父母的参与和配合,那些拒绝跟父母沟通康复情况,不让入内的机构,千万要谨慎选择。 \n专业性尤为重要。 6岁之前是所有儿童的黄金期发展期，这个时候儿童的学习能力非常强，但是如果用错了教育方法，黄金期受伤害的程度也会非常大，因此学前教育(幼儿园)的专业性跟早期干预的专业性相结合就尤为重要。 \n(部分内容来自对钟涛先生和胡晓花女士的访谈, 及孙忠凯先生的分享) 有些人认为能力不足的心智障碍儿童，必须先集中精力在机构内康复，达到某些标准之后,才能进入幼儿园/学校进行融合教育，父母会担心老师没有精力给予孩子个别化的支持,所以一切要靠心智障碍儿童自己,这对他们而言是很大的挑战。 \n\n然而，儿童是靠模仿来学习，如果能获得融合教育且不被歧视，他们隐性的学习机会非常多。例如在美国，可能95%的孤独症儿童是在普通幼儿园里融合，只有大约5%在康复机构。 03教育/社会系统\n如何看待学前融合教育\n只有康复好了，才能上幼儿园小学吗？ 美国95%的孤独症儿童是在普通幼儿园里融合，只有大约5%在康复机构。 学前融合教育有不可替代的作用\n心智障碍儿童首先是儿童,要尊重儿童的发展规律和特殊性教育部发布的《 3-6岁儿童学习与发展指南》强调：学龄前儿童的学习是以直接经验为主，主要是在日常生活和游戏中学习。因此，为6岁前的幼儿提供服务的相关人员要珍视幼儿生活和游戏的独特价值，要创设丰富的教育环境，最大限度地支持和满足幼儿通过直接感知、实际操作和亲身体验获取经验的需要。 从发展的、人本的角度看心智障碍儿童应尽可能在融合环境当中解决心智障碍儿童的特殊需求，而不是把他们看成有疾病、有缺陷的个体。站在心智障碍儿童需要什么支持的角度来考虑需要调整环境、活动及材料来支持他们的学习生活，而不是聚焦其不具备哪些能力。 如果能够做到高品质的学前融合教育， \n特殊幼儿大部分需求是能够在普通环境当中解决的国际上关于高品质学前融合教育的课程模式是金字塔模式，其基础是高品质学前教育，也就是普通教育要尽量达到高品质，尽可能在设计之初就满足所有儿童的需求。在这个基础之上，再针对特需儿童的学习需求做课程调整来促进特殊儿童的独立参与。如果课程调整后，特殊幼儿的部分特殊需求得不到满足，就可以在幼儿园的自然环境中做嵌入式教学。如果依然有部分需求得不到满足，才会考虑提供抽离的个别化教学。 \n(赵梅菊， 2022) 融合必须要有相应的支持融合的原则:充分发挥心智障碍者的自身潜能，支持他们在生命的不同阶段都有机会获得成长和发展，提升他们的生命尊严和生活品质。 \n对于进入幼儿园/学校的心智障碍儿童，不建议对校方隐瞒孩子的障碍，父母需要跟老师和康复师保持坦诚沟通，为孩子建立起有效的支持系统，例如: \n信任老师：照顾者信任教师的普教专业能支持到孩子的大多数需要。孩子刚开始融合时，给孩子和教师一个相互适应的过程，不要过于关注孩子的独自活动，融合是一个量的积累到质的飞越的过程。 \n\n服务跟着人走，不是人跟着服务走：不提倡半天机构，半天幼儿园，因为理念和方法差距太大，一个是高管控的，一个是需要自主的，尽可能避免孩子每天都需要转换生活和互动模式。有条件的幼儿园可以请康复师或者特教老师入班支持，但绝不是影子教师。 \n\n照护者要支持老师：告诉老师如何应对孩子个性化需求和行为的方法，以及如何记录孩子在校发生的一些非适应性行为。 \n\n寻求专业支持:对于老师和照护者都找不到应对方法的情况，就要及时反馈给康复师，寻求专业支持。 \n\n校园文化建设：照护者联系当地家长组织的资源，入校进行校园文化建设活动，从大环境上给孩子创造接纳、友好的融合氛围。 人读幼儿园的准备需培养幼儿的生活自理能力及沟通能力(不一定是语言) ;了解幼儿园一日生活流程，调整孩子的作息以达成一致；参观幼儿园，并花时间与园长、老师沟通；参观教室、查看生活环境、观察游戏环境和操场(是否存在物理环境的障碍，如楼梯、有无视觉提示等); \n父母需用图片、故事或视频的方式，让孩子熟悉新的环境、教室和老师，有条件的话，带孩子亲自去一趟幼儿园，让孩子感受一下环境，也让老师有机会提前了解孩子; ; \n一定要告诉孩子，您很在乎TA的感觉，方法是告诉TA “如果有类似难过、生气、害怕、兴奋等\n感觉都是很正常的情绪,爸爸妈妈都很理解你，如果你想要发泄情绪，可以告诉我们”之类的话； \n让孩子选择穿去幼儿园的服装、携带的物品等，这可以协助TA更有自信心和提高控制力，也能增加其独立意识； \n(参考文献: Parent to Parent of Georgia) 就读幼儿园之后孩子一开始可能会有分离焦虑(跟父母分开)或感到害羞、害怕，但是幼儿园老师会帮助TA调整情绪； \n\n1与老师保持沟通,父母和幼儿园的共同教育对孩子更有帮助\n\n主动参与幼儿园的活动，与孩子的老师和其他同学培养良好的关系。 \n(参考文献: Parent to Parent of Georgia) 从家庭到幼儿园、学校生活，在走向成人生活，所有人都要度过至少两个关键的转衔期，即从婴幼儿到学生的转衔和从学生到社会从业者的转衔。在每个时期，一方面要从前一个环境/场所转介到下一个环境/场所，另一方面要让前后两个阶段有所衔接，所以称为“转衔” 。这个时候，心智障碍人士的转衔会伴随很多和残障相关的特点。 与转衔相关的概念转衔期是一个人从特定生活阶段进入到一个新的生活阶段的关键期，需要伴随着有计划、目标和支持的转衔教育,包括学业和技能两方面教育。 \n转衔服务，即在一个阶段内为一个残障学生设计的一系列协调的活动，旨在提高该生的学术和功能成果，协助其向下一个生活阶段的过渡。 \n从幼儿园到小学会经历哪些变化时间:最晚在儿童进入幼儿园大班的下半年，就应完成幼升小的转衔计划制订。参与人员:父母、学前和小学的普教老师与特教老师，以及视儿童需要有必要参与\n\n的相关专业人员，如医生、物理治疗师等。 \n帮助幼儿做好幼小衔接的准备\n面对这些断层，父母需要帮助孩子在进入小学前做好真正的“衔接” 。 \n( 《让残障孩子成为最重要的自己》 , P40) 幼小衔接的时间和参与人员了解融合教育和特殊教育融合教育融合教育(inclusive Education,也翻译为全纳教育) ， 1994年6月，联合国教科文组织召开“世界特殊教育大会” ，颁布了《萨拉曼卡宣言》 ，明确提出了融合教育(全纳教育)的思想。 2017年2月，国务院发布的《残疾人教育条例》指出融合教育是指将对残疾学生的教育最大程度地融入普通教育，并提出了“积极推进融合教育，根据残疾人的残疾类别和接受能力，采取普通教育方式或者特殊教育方式，优先采取普通教育方式”的方针政策。 \n狭义的融合教育是接受残障儿童进入普通学校学习，而不是把他们分开在隔离的环境中学习。 \n广义的融合教育是不论一个人的能力、年龄、宗教、性别、民族、种族或残障，都必须在平等的环境下接受教育，每个儿童的特点都不一样，没有适合每个孩子的“整齐划一”的教授方式和学习方式，教学需要接纳和包容每个学生的独特特点，而残障只是某些孩子的特点之一。 \nr 是指将一个有显著个别差异的学生，比如孤独症儿童，经过科学专业的评估，安置在适合的教育形态中，如：安置在普通学校班级接受融合教育，或者安置在普通学校特教班，或者在特教学校接受特殊教育等。使用一般的或经过特别设计的课程、教材、教法和教学组织形式及教学设备，对有特殊需要的儿童进行的旨在达到培养目标的教育。 特殊教育安置从理想的角度看，特殊教育应该是一种资源和手段，是融合教育系统建设的一部分,但是在日常理解中，往往把特殊教育简化理解为是针对特殊人群主要是残障学生的固定的教育形式。 \n根据我国教育部定义，特殊教育安置包括四种方式： \n\n1.在特殊教育学校就读，与其他同龄非特需学生不同校\n\n2.在普通学校随班就读，与其他同龄非特需学生同校且同班\n\n3.在普通学校附设特教班，与其他同龄非特需学生同校，但不同班\n\n4.为有特殊教育需要的学生送教上门，在特需学生家庭中进行除了公办校，也可以考虑一些有教育创新理念的民办学校。 特殊教育安置图如何择校\n当孩子步入学龄阶段,许多父母都会面临为孩子选择普校还是特校的问题。此时,父母需要广泛收集信息和资料，了解有特殊教育需要的儿童可以采取什么样的教育安置方式、不同学校的接纳度如何、相关入学政策有哪些，同时积极寻求老师和其他有经验的老家长的帮助。 择校原则\n选择普通学校需要考虑那些因素？ \n1.依据政策就近就便申请入学\n2.学区内找到内部支持系统相对较好的学校所谓支持系统,依据如下判断: \n\n学校的理念和态度(对融合教育的态度、对特殊需要儿童的接纳度)是否已有特殊需要学生在读(学生数量和在校情况) \n\n学校是否配有资源教师(全职或兼职) 3.上普校应该注意什么？ 明确让孩子上普校的目的。一些经验丰富的老家长认为，上普校的前几年，最重要的是适应，让孩子适应社会规则，建立社会规范，提升孩子的社会交往能力，帮助孩子更好地融入社会，建立基本的社会性意识。 \n\n避免过高期待。孩子进入普校后，很多父母舍本逐末，格外重视孩子的学习成绩和认知能力，逐渐遗忘了进入普校的初心，最终导致孩子多方面水平下降。其实在普校，心智障碍儿童的学习要减量，无需一味向普通儿童的标准靠拢，否则孩子很容易情绪崩溃，产生厌学。有些儿童尽管属于轻度或中度障碍，但与同龄普通儿童的一般水平相比仍有一些差距，父母要避免对孩子做过高的期待。

本手册由“壹基金心智障碍者家庭支持计划”公益项目资助,由北京市晓更助残基金会融合中国心智障碍者家长组织项目网络,深圳壹基金公益基金会,北京市海淀区融爱融乐心智障碍者家庭支持中心联合开发,全国各地资源中心伙伴参与共创。 \n年龄\n系列\n手册说明\n\n这套手冊并不是一部创作， \n\n而是对众多现有资料的提炼与整合， \n\n希望能将有关心智障得者的一些基本理念、知识、信息、建议呈现给读者。因时间与能力有限，手冊肯存在诸多不足， \n\n期待读者给予反馈意见， \n\n我们也将陆续完善、更新和补充这套手冊， \n\n期待可以为更多心智障得者家庭或相关人士提供力所能及的支持。 写在开头当您展开这本手册，您可能正在寻找一些对孩子和您都有用的信息。 \n这是《心智障碍者家庭支持资源手册-年龄系列》的第二册，从年龄角度出发，以心智障碍者进入儿童和少年期的主要经历为主线，向新手父母(或其他监护人)传递一些重要的观念、知识和建议尝试的做法。 \n如果您想更加系统地了解和支持孩子，我们推荐您同时阅读《心智障碍者家庭支持资源手册-总册》 (它会介绍什么是残障和心智障碍、什么是全生命周期发展等) ,以及《心智障碍者家庭支持资源手册-障别系列》中与您孩子情况相符的分册(其中包括《发育迟缓(智力障碍) 》 《孤独症》 《唐氏综合征》和《脑瘫》 4个分册) 。 \n7-15岁，人进入身心快速成长变化阶段，开始对自己和外界有了更多更广的探索，因此他们需要发展更多的校园融合技能、自主生活能力、个人兴趣和同伴关系，去扮演好自己、家人、学生和社区成员等不同角色。作为父母(或其他监护人) ，需要去了解这个阶段孩子的特点和可能遇到的各\n\n种问题和挑战，并去学习如何\n为孩子提供必要且适度的支持。 \n希望这本手册可以为您提供一些有用的信息。 写给正在此阶段的心智障碍者家庭心智障碍者家庭支持计划由深圳壹基金公益基金会和水滴公司旗下水滴公益平台于2019年6月共同发起，聚焦城市及欠发达地区支持心智障碍者家庭资源中心和家长联络站的建设，为心智障碍者及其家庭照料者开展信息提供、同伴支持、家长赋能、个性化支持和社区合作等服务，在全国和地方层面进行公众和政策倡导，促进社会认知改变。项目由北京晓更基金会·融合中国心智障碍者家长组织网络项目组负责实施。 \n截至2021年12月底，心智障碍者家庭支持计划覆盖25个市县，服务了53168人次心智障碍者和49918人次家长，并入选界面新闻“ 2021年度杰出慈善案例榜单” 。通过《家庭满意度调查问卷》显示： 95%以上的家长表示，资源中心的存在可减轻孤立无援的感觉，对子女有更加多元和深入的了解，可提升面对子女问题的能力，增加寻找解决问题的方法和资源。 \n本套《心智障碍者家庭资源手册》围绕“信息提供”这一资源中心最为基础的功能，系统筛选梳理了相关信息，期望能为迷茫期的心智障碍者家长，心智障碍者及家庭的服务提供者，以及任何希望了解和支持心智障碍者的相关方提供信息参考。 前言庭是每个人获得支持的最小社会单元。对于心智障碍者而言， \n\n他们的照料者是终生的陪伴者和支持者，只有有效地支持到家庭成员，才能够更好地促进从家庭到心智障碍者生活质量的提升。由中国精神残疾人及亲友协会编著的《中国孤独症家庭需求蓝皮书》显示： 95%的家长认为急需专业咨询及政策信息需求， 79.1%的家长认为在孩子的康复教育等方面没有获得专业化系统培训。 基于此背景，晓更基金会希望能通过这套资源手册，将有关心智障碍者的一些基本理念、知识、信息、建议等内容进行基础性的提炼汇总，各地心智障碍者家长组织或服务机构可以在本手册基础上，结合本地有关政策、服务资源、养育经验等内容进一步补充丰富，从而更好地帮助当地心智障碍者链接或获得专门化服务、主流化服务(如基本的健康、教育、就业等)以及获得主流化服务所需的辅助性服务或支持(如社区支持、家庭教育等) 。

\n横向代表贯穿人一生的生活广度，人生的主要发展阶段和大致估算年龄:成长期(约相当于儿童期) 、探索期(约相当于青春期) 、建立期(约相当于成人前期) 、维持期(约相当于中年期)以及衰退期(约相当于老年期) 。 纵向代表纵贯上下的生活空间,由人一生中必须扮演的九种主要身份角色组成，依次是：儿童、学生、休闲者、公民、工作者、夫妻、父母和退休者。各种角色之间是相互作用的，一个角色的成功，特别是早期的角色如果发展得较好，将会为其他角色提供良好的关系基础。但是，在一个角色上投入过多的精力，而没有平衡协调各角色的关系，则会导致其他角色的失败。在每一个阶段对每一个角色投入的程度用颜色来表示,颜色面积越多表示该角色投入的程度越多。 \n\"生涯彩虹图”符合一般人的普遍情况，虽然年龄段与角色的对应随着时代发展或个人情况会有些许变化，但大体与图示相符。根据国际残障领域专家研究发现，心智障碍者在成年之前与一般人的发展阶段和扮演角色基本一致,但在成年中期后，差异逐渐显著，他们的衰退期可能比一般人早20年。 \n(中国大百科全书, 2022) 01 \n此图由内向外所示，以心智障碍者为中心，围绕他/她们的环境中可分为四类系统：家庭和社区系统、教育/社会系统、政策福利系统和医疗健康系统。根据“生涯彩虹图” ，对应这四个系统，心智障碍者在这个年龄段会扮演不同的身份角色。最外圈则是心智障碍者为扮演好每个身份角色，所需要的支持资源。本手册内容框架正是以这四个系统及对应的支持资源来展示。 家庭和居住社区系统\n7-15岁的心智障碍者需求\n接受义务教育，并需要一个过渡期接受教育是儿童的权利，无论是在普通小学里随班就读，还是到特殊教育学校上学。进入小学，意味着儿童第一次走进了有约束性管理要求的、社会化的集体环境，在学校这个规范化且相对标准化教育的环境中，所有儿童都需要经历过渡期，心智障碍儿童面临的挑战以及在过渡方面所需的时间,可能比其他同龄人更多。 掌握校园自主融合技能心智障碍儿童在校园环境中常面临不同的困难与挑战，普通教育背景下教师可能缺乏必要的精力、时间和经验去帮助心智障碍学生，而父母也由于缺乏掌握相应的方式、方法，难以为孩子提供有效的技能辅导和支持。 \n如果心智障碍儿童可以扎实掌握一些技能，例如，校园生活自理，校园融合沟通，一些不易被直接观察到的基础能力:例如一起做操、背诵、做值日，抄写以及完成作业等,这可以帮助他们展现出已具备的知识能力，促进他们学习新的知识、技能，进一步适应学校统一的测评指标。 做好体能上的准备学习是上学阶段的主导活动，儿童需要有好的精力投入学校的学习与生活。 学习自主生活能力生活永远是第一位的，自主生活是每一个儿童青少年的需要，心智障碍者也不例外。他们需要有机会为自己的生活做出选择、决定并承担责任，如：自己选择每日穿着的衣物、自己选择用什么活动打发休闲时间、学习自主购物、决定自己房间的布置陈设、承担力所能及的家务等，同时获得不同的生活体验，以提升他们自主选择和自主生活的能力。 \n入学后的家庭端支持规划父母要有一个相对理性平和的心态， \n做好充分的思想准备和行动规划父母需要对自己有一个相对准确的定位，虽然需要考虑的事、即将面临的挑战有很多，但不要让自己处于焦虑中。可以和有经验的家长事先取经学习，了解孩子上学阶段会遇到的挑战和应对策略。 家庭内部分工与家庭环境的准备围绕孩子的入学成长目标，家庭主要照顾者要有明确的责任分工和一些协作原则，有利于家庭成员的彼此支持和共同分担。在清晰的家庭分工下，有利于孩子基于相对-致的安排和要求R形成J惯规ี .例如:谁负责孩子出勤接送;谁负责与老师的沟通;谁负责孩子的课业支持;如果家庭聘请了特教助理，谁负责与特教助理订立支持计划、做定期的沟通;谁负责孩子课外的休闲娱乐及辅助的康复等。 \n合理分类并安排好孩子上学所需的物品，保证安全和舒适的家庭环境。 2.入学准备的居家训练根据《心智障碍者家庭支持资源手册-年龄系列之0-6岁婴幼儿期》中所提到幼小街接的各种准备，在家帮子女进行有针对性的入学能力准备的居家训练，例如建立与学校作息相一致的居家作息，继续培养生活自理能力，在做家务的过程中练习整理和做卫生等。 3.成长目标的设定基于入学后的潜在变化，父母可以和子女一起设定入学成长目标，不同的心智障碍者能够参与这件事的程度不同，家庭可根据实际情况，尽可能为子女提供自主表达或选择的机会，哪怕是很小的一部分，也要传达给子女一个信息：就是上学这件事与他/她自己息息相关，他她要全程参与\n目标需要符合心智障碍者的实际情况,避免过高或过低的期待。父母不能拿自己的子女与别人家孩子比较，同时对于障碍程度重的子女，也不能对抱着“没要求，只要在学校待着就行”的放任态度。 \n入学后心智障碍者遇到的实际问题会让目标变得更加清晰、具体,父母可以和子女一起来动态微调目标，让子女经过努力就有机会达到，从中获得成就感，然后去保持或向更高的目标迈进。 \n这些目标可以从多维度设定，包括:出勤目标、课程常规目标、课业目标及其他相关目标;设立几个检视目标实现情况的阶段，第一周、第一个月和第一个学期希望实现的状态和实现后的庆祝方式。例如： 与孩子共同制定目标1.召开家庭会议建议组织一个家庭会议，邀请孩子与家庭中承担主要照护责任的人都来参加，为孩子上学做一个小小的仪式性的庆祝。把上学后相比当前的生活安排所需做出的一些调整和变化,在家庭内部明确共识。为孩子进行一些心理建设，用积极正面的语言给孩子讲解上学的好处。 \n自主生活能力培养学习独处低年级学生要学会自己独立睡觉，到了高年级要学会自己独立上下学、保管钥匙、独立居家，从半天到一整天，逐步培养出独处能力，让心智障碍者学会安排自己的时间。 学习独立出行从自己走路回家开始，反复练习过马路、搭乘公共交通工具等。父母对心智障碍子女的支持，需要根据掌握这项技能的情况而逐步减退，例如从最开始的陪同，到尾随确保安全，然后放手子女短途独立出行，到最后完全独立出行。父母一定要在最初做好风险预案,当遇到问题时，可以及时做出因应处理。 自己掌握零用钱心智障碍者与普遍同龄人一样，需要有一些能自主决策使用的零用钱，父母可以鼓励子女学会记账、延迟满足消费欲望。 学做基本家务心智障碍者是家庭中的一员，而不只是受照顾的对象，所以也要承担自身能力范围内的家务劳动，如扫地、拖地、擦桌子、洗碗等，参与家务劳动不仅能培养孩子对家庭的责任感，也能锻炼他们的动手能力和专注力。 父母的支持【扩展阅读】 \n\n该节内容出自由北京融爱融乐心智障碍者家庭支持中心编写的《我的校园我做主》 ，此处只做简单介绍，详情请阅读原书。 \n(内容来自卢莹女士的经验分享) 培养兴趣不仅为了陶冶情操、发展特长，这也是心智障碍者打发休闲时光的积极方式，所以需要为心智障碍者提供尽可能多的机会，去尝试不同的休闲方式，发掘他们的兴趣，如:各种体育运动、演奏乐器、绘画、手工制作/拼装、阅读(字或图画)等等。尤其对于障碍程度较重的心智障碍者，学会自己打发休闲时光非常重要，让他们的生活能够充实、有想做的事，并从中获得满足感和对生活的掌控感。 发展个人兴趣，获取成功经验\n培养兴趣、学会休闲\n拥有同龄人普遍的常态生活心智障碍者需要有机会使用典型青少年的用品,如:手机、网络的运用。与其他普通青少年有相似的经验，有利于促进他们与同龄人的交往，有更多共同语言。当然，照顾者也需要和他们达成共识或建立行为规则,适度使用手机/网络,避免过度沉迷,影响视力和生活规律。 保持运动习惯随着心智障碍者进入学校，他们的生活半径也会产生变化。为了帮助心智障碍者适应新的环境，照护者既要有效借助旧的生活圈帮助他们调剂减压，也要逐步开发新的资源来建设校外支持圈,例如: 熟悉的亲友圈以前经常团聚的亲友小圈子，周末等时间还是可以继续聚一聚，让心智障碍者有机会处在熟悉的人和活动中，这样他们感受到的变化就不是全然一新的，对照护者而言也算是一种暂时的喘息。 与从前的老师、康复师保持联系父母可以与心智障碍子女以前所在康复机构、幼儿园的老师继续保持沟通，在子女面临一些不适应或出现问题的时候，积极获得他们的建议。 建立社区中的自然支持小区和学校的保安、上学需要搭乘的公共交通工具(公交车或校车) 、课后生活安排的一些空间和支持人员— —这些相关方都可以成为潜在资源，从安全、适应性方面给予自然而然的支持。 建立小区同伴友谊小学阶段的儿童已经具备对友谊的想法和需求，父母可以在小区甚至周边社区内帮子女逐步建立良好的同伴友谊和同伴支持。例如:可以经常跟住在同一小区的同学核对作业记录是否完整；遇到生病请假的情况，可以互相帮忙代领作业本等等。 02 \n教育/社会系统在儿童和少年时期,教育/社会系统的大部分重心处于教育领域。心智障碍者无论进入普校随班就读，还是在特殊教育学校学习，都需要得到适合他们本人的支持。其中，在普通学校进行随班就读所面临的挑战可能更多，所以此处进行着重介绍。 普通学校随班就读的正确打开方式о 根据《残疾人教育条例》以及《关于加强残疾儿童少年义务教育阶段随班就读工作的指导意见》 (以下简称“随班就读指导意见” ) ，以下是普通学校实施以随班就读为形式的融合教育的核心要素。 \n评估\nو • • • و \n1.学校应该组织班主任、学校的特殊教育资源教师、父母，并在有条件的情况下聘用康复专业人士共同参与学生评估。评估是为儿童入学后的支持计划做准备，而不是作为儿童入学的依据。因此，父母可以咨询或邀请学校进行这样的评估沟通，即使不是十分正式,但如果有一个这样的交流会议，对综合规划后续支持将非常有意义。 \n2.通过评估来规划对学生的支持，主要是基于学生的学习能力状况、学校的环境支持情况与课业标准来对照。原则上，如果在学校办理了随班就读，学校就需要为这名学生建立个别化教育档案。 \n3.从家庭角度来看，评估应该是双向的，一方面是基于对儿童的评估，另一方面也要评估学校的支持能力和资源，由此找到可以支持儿童成长学习、满足学校要求的最佳方案。 制定个别教育计划(IEP) ，落实“一人一案” 1.上述《随班就读指导意见》规定“普通学校要针对残疾学生的特性，制订个别化教育教学方案,落实\"一人一案” ,努力为每名学生提供适合的教育” \n2.上述“一人一案”提出学校要结合优势视角，综合关注学生的发展，除了文化课，更要关注开发潜能、补偿缺陷,特别是要加强行为规范教育、公共安全教育、生活适应教育、劳动技能教育、心理健康教育和体育艺术教育，帮助学生提高自主生活质量和劳动能力,培养正确的生活、劳动观念和基本职业素养，为适应社会生活及就业创业奠定基础。因此,即使心智障碍者在文化学科遇到挑战,父母也要充分利用学校内其他学习资源，如:文体艺术、社会实践、德育劳动等，促进子女的参与、融入和学习。 \n3.根据“最小限制、最小隔离、最大融合”的原则，为了更好地支持心智障碍者的学习，有条件的地方，一人一案的落实涉及到“抽离式”支持方案— —即需要从学生所在班级抽离学生到资源教室或其他环境中的特别支持。抽离的目的是为了学生更好地融入、收获和成长: \n促进发展，弥补不足，如：动作发展、思维训练等；情绪和行为问题干预，如：孩子的哭闹问题；缩小落差，如：进行某学科的补救教学； \n\n提升学习质量，如：某个学习方法、学习习惯的培养。 \n(北京融爱融乐2019年融合教育交流沙龙-朱振云老师分享摘要) 父母与班主任、资源教师及特教助理的协作关系班主任应该是儿童在学校学习生活的第一负责人，因此父母需要积极和班主任建立信任的合作关系，提升班主任的意识，使其接纳心智障碍者是班级中平等的一员、同样应该得到班主任提供的必要支持；同时父母也要做好班主任的后盾，当班主任遇到无法解决的情况，家长需要及时提供有效的支持。 资源教师应该扮演协调校内外支持资源的统筹角色,资源教师应该参加到学生的定期评估沟通工作中，根据支持方案协调其他相关资源来支持学生和老师的特别需求。对于这些个别化支持安排是否充足到位，家长可以与资源教师进行沟通协商特教助理(也称影子老师) 作用是提供辅助支持，协助班主任和任课老师正常教学，协助个案学生在校园内的学习生活。父母应该针对心智障碍子女的学校表现和支持方案，与特教助理保持密切的沟通。 营造接纳、友爱的班级氛围开发校园内的自然支持\n老师需要有意识地营造团结友爱、彼此尊重、相互支持的班级文化，也可以挖掘一些友善、耐心、性格积极阳光的同学，成为心智障碍者的固定支持者。例如，在一些小学里，班主任会为特需儿童选择几位“学习同伴” ，除了在学校中提供支持，偶尔也会在周末轮流去特需儿童家中陪伴学习或游戏。 同学成为心智障碍者的学习伙伴,发挥引导、提醒、陪伴等积极作用,支持心智障碍者更好地适应和融入课堂学习与校园生活。 父母如果有适合的机会，可以与班里其他有共同价值观的父母建立联系，通过组织一些吸引同班同学的小活动帮助心智障碍者建立同伴支持圈，同伴支持对于帮助心智障碍者融入校园、预防校园欺凌至关重要。例如，举办主题班会课，向全班同学介绍心智障碍者的特殊情况，并加以德育教育引导，鼓励同学们互助互爱，学会与不一样的人相处；设立班级乐于助人奖，与三好学生一样在期末评奖，记录成长手册，奖励正向行为，营造正向班风。 校外公益组织例如由心智障碍者家长组织提供支持，进入学校开展融合校园文化建设活动，已在全国多地开展过“友爱校园行项目” ，倡导不一样的生命形态，营造校园友爱氛围。 【补充信息】 友爱校园行项目由北京市晓更助残基金会融合中国公益项目于2016年发起，旨在通过与各地有特需儿童随班就读的普通中小学合作，立足特需儿童所在班级，开展以儿童为主导的、多元生动的融合德育课程及倡导实践活动，同时支持学校提升教职人员的融合教育理念及实施能力，从而营造友好校园文化环境，搭建儿童伙伴关系，促进特需儿童充分融入校园以及所有儿童的身心成长，让所有儿童一起上学、同班、同学。 \n扫码下载友爱校园行工具包父母如何与学校建立积极有效的沟通入门指南父母的角色是独一无二的，没有人比父母更加了解和爱护自己的孩子。每一位父母都是教育自己孩子的专家，虽然父母不可能知道所有问题的答案，但是每位父母都希望自己的孩子在学校和生活中能取得成功，作为父母的热情有助于实现出色的沟通。 开学前向学校写一封信向班主任和科任老师们介绍自己孩子的情况，诚恳不隐瞒，让老师们知道您是重视孩子家庭教育、愿意积极配合老师、愿意为孩子付出爱与责任的父母。 与孩子的学校交流时，父母请留意自己的情绪状态即使学校没有提供有效的支持，父母也切忌让学校过去(或现在)的问题、您内心的忧虑和其它负面情绪充斥着脑海。请保持冷静，关注正面心态，将注意力集中到让孩子进入普校上学的目标上，并相信学校愿意竭尽所能帮助每一位孩子。 明确目标，确定优先顺序并制定计划需要为孩子完成的最重要的事情是什么？请列出一个清单，记下涉及的争端、问题和可能的解决方案。然后为这些项目排序，决定哪些问题必须解决，哪些项目可以忽略。 积极倾听并理解他人的观点，提出问题并阐明您的观点在遇到问题,要为孩子寻求满意的解决方案时，请相信学校有意愿和家长一起面对和解决问题，只是学校对情况的了解不足以及资源不足。父母需要先了解学校的困难，并积极给予建议、一起探讨解决方案。 先准备好解决问题的若干选项，根据需要加以提出，以供讨论父母相对于学校是处在有利地位的，面对出现的各种问题，作为父母对孩子的了解和用心，可能会想到一些学校想不到的替代方案。 积极反馈，正向激励父母在关注自己孩子的同时，希望也能表明已经意识到学校有满足每个孩子需求的意愿与需要克服的困难，这能使学校更愿意为您的孩子付出额外努力，并以更具创意的方式考虑如何做出肯定回答。 \n同时,父母需要花心思长期建设关系,愿意投入时间对微小的改变做出表彰和感谢,肯定学校和老师的付出与支持等。例如，每学年结束前写一封感谢信，列举过去这一年孩子在校领导/老师/同学]的帮助下获得的进步和成长小故事,表达感谢之情,并抄送给区教育局；孩子毕业前订制感谢锦旗，在毕业典礼上赠送给学校。 \n(CADRE, 2008;卢莹女士的经验分享) 概述小升初准备。 و و 准备时间最晚在小学的最后一学期，应完成小升初的转衔计划制订。 参与人员学生及其父母、中学老师,视学生需要有必要参与的相关专业人员，如职业治疗师等，理想而言，学生的小学班主任等相关人员也要参与其中。 转衔计划内容评估目前学生的能力水平,根据评估结果制定:如何选择学校、进入初中后的目标与支持方案。 \n了解政策\n初中学业难度增加,很多心智障碍者升入初中靠的是政策支持，不是靠自身的知识水平，所以父母非常需要了解相关政策。 尽量完成九年义务教育有小学学籍的学生都可以升入初中，学籍顺延。小学毕业没有毕业证书，所有初中毕业生都能获得义务教育毕业证书。有些父母想象初中有更多困难和挑战，不想让心智障碍子女继续就读。然而初中是一个全新的环境，无论如何要让心智障碍者尝试一下，如果能遇到好的老师和同学，他们就能完成九年义务教育，拿到毕业证书。如果没有九年义务教育文凭，对未来就读职业教育学校也会有影响。如果实在读不下去，可以再想其他办法。 了解升学照顾性政策各地随班就读政策不同,有些地区只有小学可以申请随班就读;有些地区小学办理的随班就读可以顺延到初中，初一初二还可以继续申请。注意了解关于特需学生的升学照顾性政策，例如，学片内的特教班、资源教室、驻校社工站，还有合理便利原则等(详见下文说明) . \n选择目标学校\n1 \n跟随电脑派位\n2 \n如果有机会择校\n尽可能选择选择离家近、 \n公共交通方便、学片内有融合教育\n资源支持的学校就读(例如， \n有资源教室或驻校社工\n支持) 、随班就读\n口碑好的学校。 \n3 \n转学到特殊教育学校\n需要学生有残疾证；当地特殊\n教育学校的7-9年级有富余\n的学位可提供；当地教育政策\n的执行情况许。 \n4 \n转学到学片内的普校特教班\n有些地区普通学校的特教班是九年制， \n在这所学校读书的特需学生可以直接\n升入本校初中；有些没有特教班的学校， \n特需学生六年级毕业后，有机会申请\n升入同一学片内有特教班的\n学校读7-9年级。 \n5 \n参加各种特长生考试\n有特长的特需学生，例如艺术、 \n体育，如果去参加特长生考试， \n也有机会进行择校。 \n6 \n直升对口初中\n特需学生父母需要去了解片区内有哪些初中，这些学校的融合教育经验如何，以前就读的特需学生可以得到什么样的支持， \n\n学校的融合教育态度如何等。 \n做好家校沟通可申请合理便利安排学位的情况如果特需学生伴有肢体或视力障碍,可尝试向区教育局申请合理便利,就近就便安排学位。但如果只是有智力障碍或孤独症的学生，很可能没有这方面支持。 通过小学校长转介联系初中校长学校一般情况下在意父母多过于学生本身，意思是学校接收一位特需学生，更在意父母是否好说话、配合学校工作。如果父母在小学里的口碑不错，可以通过小学校长联系到初中校长,小学校长也会将家长积极、配合的态度转达给初中校长，请记住：校长之间的一句话胜过父母一万句(一定记得小学毕业时写感谢信、送锦旗给学校，办法很土，但很有用) 约见初中校长面谈交底，争取分到好的班主任，与小学同学同班心智障碍者读到初中,一般很难再继续“潜伏” (即父母不对老师透露心智障碍者的情况,而是跟班混读) ，所以需要父母提前跟校长交底，然后通过校长选择好的班主任。如果不确定能否升入心仪的学校，有的父母会去找到心仪初中的校长沟通，接纳程度高的学校会很看重父母的态度，得到校长认可后，孩子先去参加电脑派位，如果派不到这所学校，再去选择“择校” ，只要和这所学校的校长讲好，届时批准入读即可，但需要交一定金额的择校费。 通过班主任与同班同学沟通，安排比较好的小组同学父母需要先和班主任谈好,再由班主任再去跟班里的学生沟通,去安排比较友善的同学跟特需学生为一组。 关于初中军训，有如下几种选择有的特需学生障碍程度较轻，可申请一同去参加军训，尽管会遇到很多挑战，但可以通过自己的努力或在陪读老师的支持下坚持完成军训。 \n有的父母尽管不确定孩子能否应对军训这个挑战，但想尽可能给孩子一个尝试的机会,哪怕中途退出,也算是努力过。 \n有的父母则是直接放弃，学校一般会同意,因为带特需学生去军训这件事对学校同样是挑战。 \n(内容来自卢莹女士的经验分享) 制定三年目标\n初中可能是大多数心智障碍者求学过程中最辛苦的三年，学业跟不上，和新同学很难建立友谊…但在初中阶段，父母要和孩子提前设定三年目标，即希望孩子三年后以什么样的状态从初中毕业，走向高中或职业高中。 \n学业成绩在全市50%以上的学生，可以设定上普通高中的目标\n上普通高中很难，全国各地对所有学生的普高录取率也就是50% 。如果清晰定位要上普高，那么就要努力保持成绩在全市50%以上。 能参加普通中考的，可以设定上职业高中的目标\n中考是人生的里程碑建议能参加中考的就尽量去参加。因为中考是九年义务教育的句号，是心智障碍者人生的一个里程碑、一个重要的仪式，如果没有参加中考，这将是他们人生的一个遗憾。只需要经历过程，不强求结果。 父母如何与学校沟通，为孩子争取参加中考的机会并不是所有学校都愿意随班就读的学生去参加中考，因为有可能拉低平均分。曾有老家长和学校这样沟通：这些孩子(心智障碍者)未来很可能不会去参加高考，不一定能找到工作，也可能不会结婚生子，这些其他人生命中一个又一个里程碑，他们不一定都能经历。现在中考是他们人生中唯一一个有可能与同龄人一起去参与的重要事件，但凡有这个机会，希望他们不要错过。 以中考为目标需要满足的条件如果目标是参加中考，那么就要考虑这个行为需要满足什么条件，例如，要具有应考的行为、熟悉考试的常规，要知道考试是如何进行的，形成行为习惯… …所以在初中三年，尽可能让心智障碍学生去参加大大小小各种考试、测验、一模二模、体育考试、英语听力… …成绩不重要，而是去熟悉考试流程、常规、考场要求。让他们能安坐，按照规定时间填写卷子，不能随便离场，无论题会不会答，都要写满，哪怕是蒙、提前背样题也没关系。 不参加中考，也可以上职业高中学习知识跟考试成绩没有必然关系，考试成绩跟升学也没有必然关系。没有参加中考的心智障碍者也有上职业高中的机会。如果没有合适的职业高中，民办职业训练机构也是可以考虑的资源。 特殊教育学校职高班特殊教育学校也是择优录取，除了心智障碍者自己去考学，也要看各校的招生政策，并不是障碍程度重的学生就不能上职高。例如，一些一线城市的特殊教育学校，只要是本校初中毕业的学生，都可以升到本校的职高，不会区分学生个人的能力，哪怕是障碍程度重的学生,学校也都招收。这样三年之后,学生就能取得职业高中教育文凭。 \n设定三年计划\n制定好初中三年的目标之后，就要来设定初中三年的计划。不仅要平稳度过，更期待有更多的发展，让心智障碍者能够适应初中学习生活、探索继续学习的机会、融入社区和社会。 适合心智障碍者的学业计划合理作息,生活充实:制定适合心智障碍者的学业计划,安排好合理作息,以生活充实有规律为目标。 \n主科尽量跟随：尽管可能跟不上进度，但不要放弃所有学科的学业，语数英还是要辅导，否则心智障碍者在学校没事做，会出现很多问题。 \n选择走读/校外租房:老家长建议没有午睡习惯的心智障碍者，尽可能在中午时间离开学校,例如在学校附近租房或找托管中心,可以让本人和老师都放松一下。 \n培养心智障碍者良好的学习态度和学习习惯:上课做笔记，课后做作业，完成考试和测验。可以跟老师去谈，减少作业量，但不能不写，这是态度问题。不能理解的内容可以不去看，但背课文、背单词是可以的，让心智障碍者感觉很充实，但压力也不会太大。 发展优势能力，奠定未来职业发展方向发展优势能力:比如喜欢画画、演奏乐器的心智障碍者,可以尝试去发展这方面的特长。如果没有特长，哪怕只是喜欢吃，也可以向烹饪专业去发展\n参加社会实践:可以利用寒暑假寻找机会让心智障碍者参加社会实践/实习,积累经验。 \n与同龄人交往，特需学生之间的友谊发展\n\n初中是全新的环境,心智障碍者跟新同学很难交朋友。但是同校的其他特需学生，可能会在做抽离课程或参加活动时成为朋友。 \n\n在校外还可以积极参加社群活动，培养和发展特需青少年之间的友谊。 \n理解性教育关注性教育性教育有着广泛的含义，认识自己的身体、保护身体隐私、掌握恰当的社交方式、了解社交规则等等，都是性教育的重要内容。很多家庭认为孩子还小，不适合进行性教育,其实性教育需要从幼儿园阶段就开始,不能等到青春期阶段或者遇到问题才开始关注。 尽早提供适当的引导举个例子， 14岁的小明是一位心智障碍少年，他对女性的丝袜特别感兴趣，在公共场合会一直盯着女性的腿看，甚至忍不住伸手去摸，这样的行为显然不符合社交规则， \n也让小明自己面临安全隐患(被认为是性骚扰) 社会适应能力发展\n\n比如独处、外出、购物、点餐、理财、家务、志愿服务等。 \n其实，对异性感兴趣是青春期阶段的正常现象，说明小明的身心处于发展常态，这是值得高兴的事情，父母不应该因为孩子在青春期的一些懵懂的想法和行为感到羞耻而责骂孩子。然而有些父母不认为自己孩子的行为不当，反而要求别人必须理解和尊重，不能责怪他们。事实上，很多不当行为并不是心智障碍者的本质障碍,而是教育和引导不及时造成的。 \n把孩子的感受放在第一位，追求平静稳定的情绪和心态如果实在无法在学校待下去，即使休学，学籍也一定要维持下去。 \n(内容来自卢莹女士的经验分享) 青春期少年的需求及亲子关系\n青春期少年的需求青春期是成年前的准备，这个阶段的青少年本质上是非常脆弱敏感、自我为中心的。处于这一阶段的青少年很努力地在适应身体的各种变化，控制自己冲动的情绪，还要学会更多的社交技巧。他们很少能够确信自己可以被同伴或者是同龄人所接受，所以非常需要确认自己是有价值的，获得鼓励，提高自信。 亲子关系青春期阶段的亲子关系问题是很多父母遇到的挑战。这个时期，孩子跟父母的关系常常会很紧张、甚至产生冲突，虽然不是每个孩子都会如此，但是大部分孩子在青春期阶段，因为受荷尔蒙的影响，会产生一些情绪的问题。冲突意味着孩子独立需求的出现，他们一方面仍然一如既往地依赖于父母的支持，另一方面又想要有更多的独立性，所以这个阶段，父母要去理解孩子的变化并学习调整跟孩子的关系。 \n对于青春期阶段的孩子,父母需要有智慧地去应对,跟他们“斗智斗勇” ,在性教育里让孩子懂得建立责任感，让孩子知道做的事情是有后果的，他们要有承担后果的能力。 \n(融爱融乐, 2020) \n父母学习： 《性知家长(胡敏婷老师系列分享) 》 什么是校园欺凌？ 预防校园欺凌0 \n校园欺凌是全球性的问题\n国外研究表明初中阶段情绪行为障得儿童受欺凌的比例最高，达到71.8% 。 国外研究表明特需儿童遭受校园欺凌的概率是普通儿童的2-3倍，特别是初中阶段情绪行为障碍儿童受欺凌的比例最高，达到71.8% 。在不同障碍类型的学生中,孤独症儿童被认为是最容易遭受欺凌的。 定义国际定义:校园欺凌问题研究之父—挪威心理学家奥维尤斯(Olweus,D)认为，校园欺凌指受害者被一名或多名学生故意地、反复地、持续地做出负面行为，对受害者造成身体和心理上地伤害或不适应。分类:关系欺凌、言语欺凌、身体欺凌等，近年出现网络欺凌。 1 \n我国定义:我国新修订的《未成年人保护法》第130条首次从法律上定义了“学生欺凌” ,明确了学生欺凌是指发生在学生之间，一方蓄意或者恶意通过肢体、语言及网络等手段实施欺压、侮辱，造成另一方人身伤害、财产损失或者精神损害的行为。 应对措施目前的研究资料显示，应对校园欺凌的措施主要涉及三个方面：一是校园外部环境的建设，包括改善社会外部环境、健全法制；二是校园内部的建设，建立防治校园欺凌的校园管理机制,积极疏导,创造和谐环境;三是教授被欺凌者具体的自我保护技能。在实际案例中,要区分学生欺凌与学生间打闹嬉戏的界定,正确合理处理。 校园欺凌的形式\n特需学生更容易受到隐匿的欺凌澳大利亚库克大学的Dianne L.Byers等人(2011)指出，老师一般重视和严肃对待公开性的欺凌行为，而不少校园欺凌行为隐秘性导致其不易被发现。 2特殊需要学生也是如此，受其认知理解能力和社交能力的限制，更容易受到隐匿的欺凌，且无法准确描述情况。他们更容易在隐蔽场所受孤立、受到言语欺凌和身体欺凌。例如在教室里老师不在场的情况下，老师转身在黑板写字的时候，或在厕所。 这些欺凌行为包括但不限于接触身体和不接触身体两种类型，接触身体的欺凌行为，例如突然伸脚绊特需生，特需生无法判断是谁绊倒自己，甚至自己是怎么摔倒的可能都说不清楚;站队时，特需生不知道自己该站在哪里，当试图加入队伍时，有些同学会推开他说： “你不是站在这里的。 ”还有极少量非常严重的欺凌行为，例如扇耳光，在厕所里被扔厕纸或者关在厕所里，虽然极少，但会发生，影响非常恶劣。不接触身体的欺凌包括用手比划和语言欺凌，例如把手假装成枪射击特需生作为玩乐的游戏，特需生(尤其是孤独症谱系人士)对此没有反应，不知道自己在遭受欺凌。语言上的欺凌包括但不限于说： “笨蛋” “有病” ，在厕所门上写特需生的坏话等。 监护人如何发现心智障碍者受到校园欺凌? \n如何发现心智障碍者受到校园欺凌情绪上：谈及某个人感到害怕、暴躁、不安；害怕上学；有退化行为(如尿床)身体上：有伤痕、淤青等。 \n\n个人物品：作业本、书本、衣服等有人为损坏的痕迹。 监护人可以做什么监护人需要细心观察，有效跟心智障碍者沟通，了解发生了什么，如果真的发生被欺凌的情况，一定要报告，一定要处理，但绝不是以暴制暴的方式。 \n-方面教育智障}者学自์ R ,远离x自己友善的Л;另-方面需要理智地跟老师、甚至是实施欺凌学生的家长去沟通。 \n尤其要与老师共同建立在心智障碍者心中的信任感和安全感,建议老师采取一些措施来应对班级中的欺凌现象。 \n(部分内容选自卢莹女士的经验分享) 当然，并不是所有特需生都是遭受欺凌的对象，有些欺凌是特需生实施的，这些欺凌包括但不限于用手或其他物品攻击同学、破坏学校财产、偷拿同学和老师的物品、在其他同学的书上本子上乱画、吐口水、骂脏话、脱裤子露出隐私部位等。 特需学生也可能是欺凌的实施者还有些情况是有情绪或行为障碍的学生，可能难以理解某些行为的性质或把握尺度，对同学做出一些不当或过激的行为，虽然不一定是故意，但如果真的对其他人造成了伤害或损害等不良后果，监护人也是需要承担责任的。 \n(选自王建丽女士相关资料整理) 发现校园欺凌现象,老师可以做什么？ 事前预防在班级内，预防校园欺凌最重要的，是班主任要在班里建立正向正气的班风，明确班级规则,让学生明确知道班里倡导什么反对什么。 \n班主任平时对待每个学生的态度、对每件事的看法和做法会直接影响班里学生如何对待其他同学，所以班主任自身要有明确的是非观，平时多表扬学生正向的行为，对于欺凌行为，在有苗头时就要严厉制止，预防愈演愈烈，坚决制止恃强凌弱的行为。 \n班主任和科任教师在平时要营造一种尊重多元、团结友爱的班级氛围，同时对于特需学生多一些关注和耐心，当然又不能搞特殊，尽量在纪律方面一致要求。给特需学生安排品行端正的结对小伙伴,提高其社交技能和参与度,不仅可以帮助特需学生融入学校生活，还能预防欺凌。 \n用专门时间(例如班会)使用绘本、角色扮演、讨论等形式，对班级平时出现的问题进行教学，教导学生正确看待不同的人和处理同学关系的方法。要使用情境式体验式的教学方法，不用说教的方法。 \n邀请专业人士例如专门处理校园欺凌事件的律师，对学生和父母进行必要的法制教育，教导学生和父母分清欺凌行为和一般玩闹行为之间的区别，使用案例让学生和父母明白实施欺凌行为的严重后果，有可能会有出警记录，严重的还会负法律责任。 事中干预立即严厉制止实施欺凌的行为，检查被欺凌学生的伤情，让实施欺凌的学生道歉，警告实施欺凌的学生不能有下一次。 事后教育要一对一严厉告诉实施欺凌者这种行为不对，属于违法行为，注意要态度严厉，语气低沉,不要使用尖锐高挑的声音,注意语言文明,不能辱骂学生，更不能在全班面前用类似于批斗的方式对待实施欺凌的学生。 \n教导被欺凌学生应对欺凌的方法,例如,辨别哪些是欺凌行为，走路时绕开经常实施欺凌的同学，被欺凌时大声呼救，求助老师。 \n注意要预防下一次的欺凌发生,例如,派结对小伙伴跟随被欺凌的同学,找出欺凌经常发生的时间地点规律，老师要通过提前出现在欺凌地点、调整实施欺凌学生与被欺凌学生同时去洗手间的时间、调换座位、站队时将二人分开、及时发现欺凌行为的苗头并制止等方法预防欺凌的发生对障碍程度重的心智障碍学生，有哪些避免被欺凌的有效办法中度及中重度障碍学生进入普校学习，提高其个人应对校园欺凌的技能可能比较有限，所以有效的办法可以包括: \n\n老师引导学生正确认识对待不一样的同学，建立融洽、友好的班级氛围。老师要经常出现在学生容易受欺凌的场所，及时发现和阻止欺凌行为，给实施欺凌行为的学生以足够的震慑力。 \n\n为特需学生安排助学小伙伴，在必要的时候提供保护。 \n\n如果有条件的话，可以配备特教助理教师. \n(选自王建丽女士相关资料整理) 03

        "text": "目录\n从小家到大家：让心智障碍者家庭不孤单、不绝望！ 心智障碍者家庭支持计划由深圳壹基金公益基金会和水滴公司旗下水滴公益平台于2019年6月共同发起，聚焦城市及欠发达地区支持心智障碍者家庭资源中心和家长联络站的建设，为心智障碍者及其家庭照料者开展信息提供、同伴支持、家长赋能、个性化支持和社区合作等服务，在全国和地方层面进行公众和政策倡导，促进社会认知改变。项目由北京晓更基金会·融合中国心智障碍者家长组织网络项目组负责实施。 \n截至2021年12月底，心智障碍者家庭支持计划覆盖25个市县，服务了53168人次心智障碍者和49918人次家长，并入选界面新闻“ 2021年度杰出慈善案例榜单” 。通过《家庭满意度调查问卷》显示： 95%以上的家长表示，资源中心的存在可减轻孤立无援的感觉，对子女有更加多元和深入的了解，可提升面对子女问题的能力，增加寻找解决问题的方法和资源。 \n本套《心智障碍者家庭资源手册》围绕“信息提供”这一资源中心最为基础的功能，系统筛选梳理了相关信息，期望能为迷茫期的心智障碍者家长，心智障碍者及家庭的服务提供者，以及任何希望了解和支持心智障碍者的相关方提供信息参考。 前言家庭是每个人获得支持的最小社会单元。对于心智障碍者而言，他们的照料者是终生的陪伴者和支持者，只有有效地支持到家庭成员，才能够更好地促进从家庭到心智障碍者生活质量的提升。由中国精神残疾人及亲友协会编著的《中国孤独症家庭需求蓝皮书》显示： 95%的家长认为急需专业咨询及政策信息需求， 79.1%的家长认为在孩子的康复教育等方面没有获得专业化系统培训。 基于此背景，晓更基金会希望能通过这套资源手册，将有关心智障碍者的一些基本理念、知识、信息、建议等内容进行基础性的提炼汇总，各地心智障碍者家长组织或服务机构可以在本手册基础上，结合本地有关政策、服务资源、养育经验等内容进一步补充丰富，从而更好地帮助当地心智障碍者链接或获得专门化服务、主流化服务（如基本的健康、教育、就业等）以及获得主流化服务所需的辅助性服务或支持（如社区支持、家庭教育等） 。 北京市晓更助残基金会常务副秘书长\n\n梁志图现在是2022年，距离壹基金创始人李连杰先生参演的电影《海洋天堂》上映过去了12年，距离壹基金发起海洋天堂计划过去了11年。这个公益项目从关注孤独症群体到更大的心智障碍者人群，由“我”到“我们” ，从个人需求转化为公共议题，我们也一起见证了心智障碍者家长、家长组织、家长网络的成长和良性发展。我们同全国家长们一起从服务特殊需要人群，到组织和骨干能力建设，再到政策促进，以及公众环境教育。 从一生需求出发， 2019年6月，深圳壹基金公益基金会和水滴公司旗下水滴公益平台共同发起心智障碍者家庭支持计划，聚焦城市及欠发达地区支持心智障碍者家庭资源中心和家长联络站的建设，以街道、社区为单位，为各地心智障碍者及其家庭照料者开展信息提供、同伴支持、家长赋能、个性化支持和社区合作等服务，希望可以改善家长们孤立无援的处境，帮助家长们增强解决子女问题的方法和能力。 《心智障碍者家庭资源手册》属于该项目的一部分，期望能为迷茫期的您提供信息参考。 \n深圳壹基金公益基金会联合公益部主任\n任少鹏北京市海淀区融爱融乐心智障碍者家庭支持中心骨干家长/彭卫平/ 我的儿子今年24岁，伴有智力发育迟缓。他是一个青春、阳光、内敛的男生，有主见、有想法，在社会各类支持体系下，基本能自主安排生活。他目前大专在读，同时兼做几家公益组织的视频剪辑工作，正在大三实习中，即将面临毕业，迈入人生下一个阶段。 \n作为父母，我们没有耗费时间在孩子康复和补习功课上，而是跟随孩子身体和智力的发育情况，创造机会让他更多地接触社会，学会如何生活。像对待普通孩子一样对待他，鼓励他保持运动习惯、强身健体的同时，也让他有机会涉猎音乐、绘画、舞蹈、影视等各种艺术门类去陶冶情操，获得自信、愉悦和身心的满足。 \n悦纳孩子，共同成长，让我们成为互相支持的好家人。 悦纳孩子，共同成长，让我们成为互相支持的好家人。 \n认识发育迟缓和智力障碍\n什么是发育迟缓/智力障碍？ 发育迟缓(Developmental Disability)常用来描述儿童在运动、体格、智力、语言、心理这五个方面的发展进度达不到同龄人的常态发育水平。 \n影响儿童智力发育的因素众多，涉及面广，其中主要涉及生物、环境、心理、遗传、营养、家庭、社会、经济、地理等因素，且这些因素之间相互联系、相互影响。 \n智力障碍(Intellectual Disability)发生于发育时期，即18岁之前；对个人\n智力障碍\n智力功能的障碍。如推理、问题解决、计划、抽象思维、判断、学业学习和从经验中学习\n适应行为的障碍。在不同环境中(家庭、学校、职场和社区)表现为一个或多个日常生活功能受限，如交流、社会参与和独立生活\n北京市海淀区融爱融乐心智障碍者家庭支持中心骨干家长我的孩子11岁，伴有发育迟缓，目前正在普通小学四年级进行随班就读。 /徐庆萍/ \n发育迟缓人士可能遇到的挑战他是名善良温暖的帅哥，对世间万物充满爱意。除了学习任务，其他事交给他都让人放心。只是遇到难事容易钻牛角尖，情绪不时有些小冲动。 \n养育一个有特殊需求的孩子，给初次为人父母的我们带来了太多的困难和挑战，让我们痛苦，也常常感到迷失方向。而恰恰也有那么一些时候，让我感觉孩子就是我的贵人，是来“渡”我的，因为成为他的妈妈，让我体验着世间痛苦的同时，也让我切身的品味到了生活的甜蜜滋味，这些苦辣酸甜就像不同的色彩晕染着我的生活，充盈了我的生命。现在的我眼中有光、心中有爱、手上有温度。 \n作为家长，若总低头看脚下的泥泞，就难以辨别前进的方向，所以，抬起头来，请向前路远望，追光而行吧！ 抬起头来，请向前路远望，追光而行吧! \n/王晓红/ 北京市海淀区融爱融乐心智障碍者家庭支持中心骨干家长\n我的孩子今年15岁，伴有发育迟缓，完成小学六年级课程后，目前在家教育。 \n发育迟缓并不会像我们以为的“就是比普通孩子晚两年”那样，想要在日常生活中准确判断他们的发展水平和需求，是具有困难和迷惑性的，这就需要我们每一位专注又有爱的爸爸妈妈去用心发现和认识。 \n发育迟缓的孩子经常出现卡顿的地方，往往是我们习以为常的、最基础的部分。因此，在认知外界事物的时候，常需要我们仔细聆听他们的心声，了解他们的需求。 \n他们当中的大部分人都有掌控自己身体行动的需求，但常常会显现出无力感。因此，要教给他们适合的锻炼方式，比如屈曲运动就可以很好地帮助他们锻炼腰腹部的核心力量。 \n发育迟缓可能会伴随孩子的一生，但是教育路漫漫，我不想说加油，因为这有点像对短跑健将说的，他们的一生更需要耐力和坚持，让我们一起携手共进，细水长流、一点一点地做起来吧。 老家长对发育迟缓人士的观察\u0007 心智发展跟不上身体发育的速度例如，一名11-12岁有发育迟缓的少年，身高可能已经有170厘米，但心智仍然处在5-6岁儿童的水平，像是开心的时候就拍手，对喜欢的人特别亲昵… …这些行为方式常常会因为与他们高大外形的强烈反差，引起周围人的误会。 因为发展不平衡，发育迟缓人士可能常常得不到及时、有效的支持发育迟缓人士有一定的社交意愿，这与孤独症谱系障碍人士不同。照顾者或其他人可能会因为没有发现发育迟缓人士的真实需求，而对他们提出过高的要求。因为发展不平衡，发育迟缓人士在不同方面表现出来的优势和不足可能差距很大。例如，一名发育迟缓人士可能会弹钢琴，但TA在穿衣、 当一些发育迟缓人士听到别人说的话，他们可能需要更长的时间，在大脑中处理这句话的信息、理解意思，当发现他们出现“卡壳” 、 “反射弧长”的状况，往往是因为别人说的话中有他们不明白的词，或者语句过于复杂。有时还可能表现为对个别词语无法正确理解和使用。 \n\n能理解语言的表面意思，却难以正确理解对方的暗示、比喻等隐含意思。 对于事物和语言的理解、表达和使用，存在不同程度的障碍刷牙等生活自理方面仍然需要照顾者的支持和引导。照顾者认为每个人都应该了解的“常识” ，实际上发育迟缓人士依然不知道，他们也因此常常得不到有效的支持。 \n心理比较敏感，不太懂得如何应对挫折，这需要照顾者有意去引导和教育\n来源：心智障碍者家长王晓红说明：心智障碍者家庭支持手册的年龄系列、法律政策、各地资源及使用指南编写中，将于2022年陆续发布，扫描本手册封底二维码，查看和下载最新版资源手册。 全国各地心智障碍者家庭资源中心联系方式本册编写参考资料\n\n1.美国精神医学学会， 《精神障碍诊断与统计手册》 DSM-5 \n\n2.曹瑞霞， 《小儿发育迟缓的评估与诊断》 [J].临床医药文献电子杂志， 2020 ，第7卷(57):189 ，196. \n\n3.北京市残疾人联合会， 《家庭康复培训指导丛书-智障儿童康复》 \n\n4.香港协康会（ 2017 ） ， 《学前发展障碍儿童康复社会工作实务手册》 ，中山大学出版社\n\n5.香港匡智会（ 2009 ） ， 《智能障碍者心理健康及精神疾病手册》 ，P16 \n\u0007 \n|北京市海淀区融爱融乐心智障碍者家庭支持中心快乐活动营\n6.心智障碍者家长,王晓红\n7.

前言家庭是每个人获得支持的最小社会单元。对于心智障碍者而言，他们的照料者是终生的陪伴者和支持者，只有有效地支持到家庭成员，才能够更好地促进从家庭到心智障碍者生活质量的提升。由中国精神残疾人及亲友协会编著的《中国孤独症家庭需求蓝皮书》显示： 95%的家长认为急需专业咨询及政策信息需求， 79.1%的家长认为在孩子的康复教育等方面没有获得专业化系统培训。

\n我儿子从小在融合环境中学习生活，在磕磕碰碰中一直成长，学会了各项自主生活的技能：独立乘坐交通工具上下班，可以照顾自己，还能协助做一些家务活，做简单饭菜，而且把业余生活安排得丰富多彩… …这些都得益于社区环境的包容接纳，专业的支持体系，甚至社会的进步与政策的改善。 \n接纳孩子和父母自已的不完美，与不完美共存，享受美好的生活。 与不完美共存，享受美好的生活。 说明：孤独症（又称自闭症） ，根据中国残疾人联合会《关于在宣传报道中规范残疾人及残疾人工作有关称谓的通知》 （残联宣文函〔 2022 〕12号） ， “统一称‘孤独症’ ，不用‘自闭症’ 。 ”故本手册正文中使用“孤独症”一词。 认识孤独症谱系障碍\n什么是孤独症谱系障碍？ 孤独症谱系障碍（ Autism Spectrum Disorder ，以下简称孤独症）是一种影响社会交往和行为发展的发育障碍，通常在出生后的几年就会被发现。 \n来源： Wiggins, L. and Rice, C., et al.,2018 \n根据美国精神病学协会最新一版《精神障碍诊断与统计手册》 (DSM-5) ，将孤独症、阿斯伯格综合征、儿童瓦解症以及未分类的广泛性发育障碍统称为孤独症谱系障碍。我国将孤独症列为精神障碍类别。 \n医学上对孤独症谱系障碍的成因尚无肯定结论，目前发生人数增长迅速，仅中国的孤独症人士已经有1000多万，其中相当一部分已经成年。男孩的发生率是女孩的4-6倍。来源：周玲， 2020 \n> \n1000多万中国孤独症人士孤独症的主要表现是社会交往障碍、交流障碍以及限定性的重复或刻板行为、兴趣和活动。来源： Wiggins, L. and Rice, C., et al.,2018) \n这些障碍会对孤独症人士在日常生活、学校、工作场所、社会中的行为和适应造成诸多挑战，也常因此被大众误解甚至污名化。这些障碍也会造成孤独症人士在各方面的发展不平衡，比如有些方面可能随年龄增长而发展，但其他方面却明显发展不足。他们很可能难以将记忆中的信息和目前发生的事件整合在一起，不懂得如何去总结经验，难以预测将会发生的事情。 \n他们有时看起来似乎对什么都漠不关心，但有时他们会对他人看来微不足道和毫无意义的特定物品或者经历表现出特别的迷恋。 \n来源: 《孤独症谱系障碍：家长及专业人员指南》洛娜·温著，孙敦科译， 2013 孤独症人士似乎完全躲在自己的世界里，专心致志于他们自己的活动中，对其他人漠不关心，跟他们打招呼、说话，他们也不会做出反应。 社会交往的障碍除了特别生气、苦恼或喜悦的时候,他们的面部可能毫无表情。 \n他们可能盯着你看，或者根本不看你,或者只是偶然斜着眼睛快速一瞥。 \n你试图拥抱或抚摸孤独症儿童，他们可能会挣脱离开，或者从你身边走过但不停留。 \n他们会抓着你的手或胳膊，用你的手去够他们想要的东西，或者去为他们执行一个动作，如转动门把手，一旦他们得到想要的那件东西，就不会再理睬你了。 \n可能在挠痒痒、晃动身体、在地板上滚动、或者追来追去的时候，孤独症儿童也许会开心大笑，甚至会看向你，希望能够继续下去，可是一旦游戏结束，他们又会回到疏离的状态。 \n有一些孤独症人士可能会主动去接近负责照料他们的人，且常常以单方面的形式提出要求，或者一而再再而三地谈到他们自己所关切的事情，却不关注对方的感情和需要。但是，如果得不到他们所要求的那种注意，他们就会变得很难相处。 \n一些高功能、语言发展水平较好的孤独症青年和成人，可能会表现得过分彬彬有礼，甚至显得有些古板。他们力图表现出良好的行为举止，却只能僵硬地固守社会互动的那些规则，因为他们虽然习得了这些规则，但并不真正理解，也难以做出因应场合的调整。 交流的障碍语言发展障碍是孤独症人士的常见状况，但严重程度各不相同，在所有孤独症人士中，大概有四分之一或五分之一从来没有语言。 \n\n很多人开始发展语言的时间要比普通儿童延迟很多，往往从重复别人的话开始，尤其是重复最后一个或几个词，可能只是原样模仿其语音和音调，但并不理解词的意义，有时也称这种情况为鹦鹉学舌似的“仿说” 。 \n\n有些人可能会常常混淆语法和词义，对于人称代词也不容易掌握，很难区分“你” “我”等身份指代。 \n\n一些孤独症人士能够与他人进行交流，但他们的语言内容是重复的，而非交谈式的。比如他们可能会重复同一个问题，尽管已经有了答案；或者不顾听众的反应，对自己特别感兴趣的内容进行独白。 \n\n他们通常只能理解语言的字面意思，无法理解比喻、暗示或者那些模棱两可的话。 \n\n孤独症人士对于非口语的表达，如手势、面部表情以及肢体动作的理解，也存在一定程度的困难。 \n孤独症儿童很难理解过家家、扮演角色这样想象性的游戏，而是更倾向于重复性的活动。有的孤独症人士会对喜欢的故事/影片情节等一遍又一遍地重复听/观看，甚至熟悉到可以整段复述，一旦漏掉一个词他们都会知道，但他们对故事情节并不具备富有想象力的理解。 重复或刻板行为、兴趣和活动很多简单的重复活动表现为各种重复的感觉，如：尝一尝、闻一闻、摸一摸、敲一敲等；听一听机械的声响；盯着灯光或者闪闪发光的东西看；扭动、转动双手或近在眼前的物品；从各种不同的角度盯着东西看；开灯、关灯；观看旋转的东西，或者自己不停地旋转；经常拍手、挥舞手臂、上下跳跃、转头、摇晃身体等。 \n有时这种重复的活动表现为咬自己、撞头、打头、抓挠等，或者其他形式的自伤行为，这类行为经常是对痛苦、愤怒或者受到挫折的一种反应，但是，自伤行为也可能成为某个人在无事可做时的一种重复的习惯。 \n有时表现在复杂重复的常规。如：要把物品排成一行，或者把物品放在固定的地方，且不准打乱；走路时喜欢走同一条路线，拐弯时喜欢拐直角等。这种常规不允许被打乱，否则会极度心烦意乱，甚至开始闹情绪。 有些孤独症人士可能对某些物品产生依恋，拒绝与之分开；或者执着于收藏一些东西，如：有的孤独症人士喜欢收集洗涤剂瓶子，有可能见到洗涤剂就去拿，无论是在自己家里、别人家里或者超市里，如果TA知道要等清空瓶子之后才能收藏， TA会去倒掉里面的洗涤剂。来源: 《孤独症谱系障碍：家长及专业人员指南》 \n\n洛娜·温著，孙敦科译， 2013 同路人语1福建省心启航助残帮助中心快乐活动营我的孩子是一个受孤独症影响的10岁男孩，他对声音敏感，语言表达困难，原来还特别挑食。他有很典型的孤独症障碍，但让我们夫妻感到欣慰的是他没有情绪和行为问题，目前顺利进入普校就读一年级(全程陪读) ，学校老师比较接纳，班级氛围也很好，我们觉得这和我们对他的支持理念有很大关系。 孩子被诊断不久，我和妻子就开始不断学习孤独症相关的干预方法。当时温州培训机会少，如果听到哪些地方有好的专家培训,我们都会尽量争取去参加,为此跑了深圳、上海好多地方。在这个过程中，我逐渐认识到，再多的方法，最后都离不开两个基础,那就是：爱与接纳。关键是我们如何看待障碍,如果我们忽视了孩子本身的需求而只看到障碍，那么对他和对父母来说,都会很艰难。现在，我们并不想改变他什么，只是想给他更合适的支持，去感受生命的不同与精彩。

\n家庭支持中心绘画活动孤独症人士是天才吗？ 您可能从一些影视作品或媒体报道中看到一些孤独症人士具有很强的天赋，例如有超强的乐感、运算能力或记忆力等，这些都是孤独症中的一种高功能的类型，但他们的比例不到总数的万分之一。 \n通常，孤独症人士在多方面都会受到影响，因而表现出的轻重程度也非常不同。 \n受轻度影响的孤独症人士，比如阿斯伯格综合征或者高功能孤独症人群，在学业方面和自己擅长的领域比较出色，可是他们仍会经历社会交往困难。 \n受重度影响的孤独症人士，可能会有学习困难、注意力很难集中、刻板行为等等，他们对外界（他人和辅具）的支持需求更高。 \n来源：北京市残疾人联合会孤独症征兆一般出现在什么时期？ 孤独症儿童一般在3岁左右能被家长发现，其中2/3的患儿出生后逐渐出现孤独症征兆，约1/3的患儿经历了1-2年常态发育后出现倒退，并开始出现孤独症征兆。 \n3岁左右也是最佳的干预期，有研究表明，孤独症儿童在6岁前开始接受科学干预，比更大年龄才开始的效果明显得多。 \n综合国内外专家对父母的建议， \n如果孩子具有如上征兆，父母应尽早带孩子到专业医疗机构进行评估，然后及早开始相关的干预。如上内容只是作为参考，并不是说有这些征兆的孩子就是孤独症。 \n来源：北京市残疾人联合会“心智障碍者家庭支持计划”的愿景目标\n\n探索创新性、系统性解决方案，推动从家庭改变到社会改变。从小家到大家，促进心智障碍者家庭生活福祉构建和社会融入。聚水成川，点亮生命，让心智障碍者家庭不孤单、不绝望！ 别让确诊的漫漫长路耽误了孩子的黄金干预期有调查表明，我国孤独症儿童从初诊到确诊，大约要经历1年左右的时间，有些甚至更长。医生有时会对3岁左右的儿童诊断为“疑似” ，因此，一些父母为了求确诊、求心安，不惜花费几年时间，带孩子奔波在全国各大医院做诊断。 \n康复医学认为， 6岁以前是心智障碍儿童的黄金干预期，父母可以先尝试带孩子接受一些专业的、科学的早期教育和早期干预，不一定非要等到确诊才开始。 有可能是其他疾病吗？ 在儿童接受诊断时，一般专业人员会首先排除其他疾病，比如听力障碍、语言发育迟缓或身体方面的不适。听力障碍者对任何声音都没有反应，但孤独症人士会对非常喜欢、或让他们不适的声音做出回应；语言发育迟缓的儿童虽然会因为自身语言能力有限而对社交产生胆怯，但不会像孤独症儿童那样拒绝或逃避互动。 \n中国有句老话“贵人语迟” ，成为很多家长逃避孩子问题的一个借口。父母可以这样来看待诊断和干预：目前对于孤独症的诊断和干预是没有创伤性的，适当、适合的干预对儿童是有好处的。如果孩子真的是“贵人” ，那么当孩子开口讲话，并且各方面与同龄孩子表现相仿时，停止训练就可以了。但如果儿童确实有特殊教育的需要，那么早起步要比晚起步效果明显得多。 \n来源：北京市残疾人联合会\n2007年12月联合国大会通过决议，从2008年起，将每年的4月2日定为“世界提高孤独症意识日” ，以提高人们对孤独症和相关研究与诊断以及孤独症人士的关注，强调必须帮助改善孤独症人士的生活质量，这样他们才能作为社会的一个组成部分过上充实而有意义的生活。 \n\n来源：联合国， 2022 \n孤独症没有特效药物治疗，会伴随终身。早期诊断、干预，可以改善孤独症对个体的影响，提升个体的发展水平，因此孤独症干预一般认为是年龄越小开始、效果越好，但是并没有一个年龄的截止点，事实上很多孤独症人士因为得到了适合的、持续的支持，在较大年龄时依然可以获得改善。 \n世界各国尤其是发达国家建立了许多的孤独症特殊教育和训练课程体系，但各种方法兼有优缺点，尚无证据表明哪一种方法显著优于另外一种。各种方法有互相融合的趋势。 \n由于孤独症缺乏特效治疗，尚存在数以百种的另类疗法(alternative therapy) ，这些疗法缺乏循证医学证据，选择需慎重。

心智障碍者家庭支持计划由深圳壹基金公益基金会和水滴公司旗下水滴公益平台于2019年6月共同发起，聚焦城市及欠发达地区支持心智障碍者家庭资源中心和家长联络站的建设，为心智障碍者及其家庭照料者开展信息提供、同伴支持、家长赋能、个性化支持和社区合作等服务，在全国和地方层面进行公众和政策倡导，促进社会认知改变。项目由北京晓更基金会·融合中国心智障碍者家长组织网络项目组负责实施。 \n截至2021年12月底，心智障碍者家庭支持计划覆盖25个市县，服务了53168人次心智障碍者和49918人次家长，并入选界面新闻“ 2021年度杰出慈善案例榜单” 。通过《家庭满意度调查问卷》显示： 95%以上的家长表示，资源中心的存在可减轻孤立无援的感觉，对子女有更加多元和深入的了解，可提升面对子女问题的能力，增加寻找解决问题的方法和资源。 \n本套《心智障碍者家庭资源手册》围绕“信息提供”这一资源中心最为基础的功能，系统筛选梳理了相关信息，期望能为迷茫期的心智障碍者家长，心智障碍者及家庭的服务提供者，以及任何希望了解和支持心智障碍者的相关方提供信息参考。 前言家庭是每个人获得支持的最小社会单元。对于心智障碍者而言，他们的照料者是终生的陪伴者和支持者，只有有效地支持到家庭成员，才能够更好地促进从家庭到心智障碍者生活质量的提升。由中国精神残疾人及亲友协会编著的《中国孤独症家庭需求蓝皮书》显示： 95%的家长认为急需专业咨询及政策信息需求， 79.1%的家长认为在孩子的康复教育等方面没有获得专业化系统培训。 基于此背景，晓更基金会希望能通过这套资源手册，将有关心智障碍者的一些基本理念、知识、信息、建议等内容进行基础性的提炼汇总，各地心智障碍者家长组织或服务机构可以在本手册基础上，结合本地有关政策、服务资源、养育经验等内容进一步补充丰富，从而更好地帮助当地心智障碍者链接或获得专门化服务、主流化服务（如基本的健康、教育、就业等）以及获得主流化服务所需的辅助性服务或支持（如社区支持、家庭教育等） 。

\n儿子在1周岁的时候还不会爬、不会站、不会说话，才去医院检查，确诊为脑瘫，医生说需要终身康复干预。这个打击对于一个家庭是致命的，从绝望到接受需要时间，但是这个过程越短，对孩子越好。当遇到这样的孩子时，谁都有绝望的那一刻，但静下来想想，既然我们无法改变生活，那就要改变自己，让自己更强大。 \n对于脑瘫的孩子，康复没有捷径，就是坚持不懈地训练，从量变到质变。但是康复是需要我们动脑子的，而不是机械地去做。我们不能把孩子当成训练机器，首先他是独立的人，只是需要我们的陪伴、支持和爱。 在儿子1岁到8岁这个密集康复的阶段，与其说我在陪伴他，不如说是儿子成就了现在的我，我们一起努力，都成为了更好的自己。现在儿子已经19岁了，阳光、自信、充满正能量。虽然他说话还不清楚，但不妨碍他和普通人一样交流；虽然他手不灵活，但不妨碍他为家人做些力所能及的家务；虽然他身体不协调，但不妨碍他和同伴们一起游泳、打篮球、打羽毛球、徒步、爬山。这就是我要的生活，也是他要的生活。 认识脑瘫\n什么是脑瘫？ 脑瘫（ cerebral palsy, CP ）全称为脑性瘫痪（我国台湾地区称脑性麻痹） ，是一组持续存在的中枢性运动和姿势发育障碍、活动受限症候群，这种症候群是由于发育中的胎儿或婴幼儿脑部非进行性损伤所致。脑瘫的运动障碍常伴有感觉、知觉、认知、交流和行为障碍，以及癫痫和继发性肌肉、骨骼问题。 \n来源：中国脑性瘫痪康复指南， 2015 ，p.749 发生概率脑瘫在全球范围都有较高的发生率，我国脑瘫发生率与国际平均水平接近，约为2.48 ‰ ，各地区因医疗水平差异，发生率有所不同，约为千分之二(2 ‰)到千分之五(5 ‰)之间。全国脑瘫人士约500万，每年新增脑瘫儿童约4万名。 \n来源：李晓捷，邱洪斌，姜志梅等2018 ；杨红，史惟，王艺,2011 发生原因脑瘫的发生原因比较复杂，包括先天性发育缺陷因素（畸形、宫内感染）和获得性因素（早产、低出生体重、窒息、缺氧缺血性脑病、核黄疸、外伤、感染等） ，部分案例还找不到明确的原因。多数脑瘫人士为非先天性因素所致，后天获得性因素引起的脑瘫一般不会遗传。来源：中国脑性瘫痪康复指南， 2015 同时伴随不同程度的智能障碍和运动障碍，这类脑瘫人士属于心智障碍者中的一类。 \n脑智瘫能伴障随碍脑肢瘫体伴障随碍\n伴随不同程度的运动障碍，未伴随明显的智力障碍，常常被归为肢体障碍者。 从临床分类来看，脑瘫可分为6类痉挛型四肢瘫（ spastic quadriplegia ） \n\n主要表现为四肢肌张力增高，上肢背伸、内收、 \n\n内旋，拇指内收，躯干前屈，下肢内收、内旋、 \n\n交叉、膝关节屈曲、剪刀步、尖足、足内外翻， \n\n拱背坐，腱反射亢进、踝阵挛、 \n\n折刀征和锥体束征等。 \n痉挛型双瘫（ spastic diplegia ）症状同痉挛型四肢瘫，主要表现为双下肢\n\n痉挛及功能障碍重于双上肢。 \n痉挛型偏瘫（ spastic hemiplegia ）症状同痉挛型四肢瘫，表现在一侧肢体。 不随意运动型（ dyskinetic ） 主要包括舞蹈性手足徐动（ chroeo-athetosis ）和肌张力障碍（ dyston-ic ） ；该型最明显特征是非对称性姿势，头部和四肢出现不随意运动，即进行某种动作时常夹杂许多多余动作，四肢、头部不停地晃动，难以自我控制。该型肌张力可高可低，可随年龄改变。静止时肌张力低下，随意运动时增强，对刺激敏感，表情奇特，挤眉弄眼，颈部不稳定，构音与发音障碍，流涎、摄食困难，婴儿期多表现为肌张力低下。 共济失调型（ ataxia ） 以小脑受损为主，主要特点是由于运动感觉和平衡感觉障碍造成不协调运动。为获得平衡，两脚左右分离较远，步态蹒跚，方向性差。运动笨拙、不协调，可有意向性震颤及眼球震颤，平衡障碍、站立时重心在足跟部、基底宽、醉汉步态、身体僵硬。肌张力可偏低、运动速度慢、头部活动少、分离动作差。 \n混合型(mixed types)同时具有以上提到的两种以上类型的特点。 脑瘫的表现\n脑瘫的早期征兆脑瘫的类型和障碍级别不同，所以表现也多种多样，婴幼年时期主要表现在发育指标/里程碑的延迟，包括单纯的运动发育（包括大运动和精细运动） 、语言发育或认知发育的滞后，例如： \n•    6周龄/对声音或视觉刺激无反应\n\n•    3月龄/无社交反应\n\n• 6月龄/不能做抬头等动作，对头部的控制差\n\n• 9月龄/不会坐\n\n• 12月龄/不会用手指物\n\n• 18月龄/不会走路和不会说单字2岁/不会跑和不能说词语\n\n3岁/不能爬楼梯或用简单的语句交流\n• \n\n• \n还表现在： \n\n•持续哭闹\n\n•   手指紧握不会张开\n\n•   全身发软、无力或四肢发紧、打挺\n\n•   易惊，少动或过多地乱动\n\n•   吃奶无力，经常呛、噎、吐奶\n\n•   哭声微弱或阵阵尖叫\n\n•抱起时，腿部僵硬，像剪刀一样交叠在一起\n父母需细心观察，如果发现孩子出现如上情况，请及时带孩子到医院进行诊断，以便尽早提供孩子所需的支持。 发育协调障碍•障碍在发育早期出现。 \n•运动协调性达不到普通同龄人应该获得的运动技能，动作显得有些笨拙、缓慢、不精确。 \n\n•这种运动障碍可能会持续而明显地影响脑瘫个体，所以需要经过专业评估，为脑瘫人士提供足够的支持，以保证他们能够以更高的质量参与到日常生活、学业、工作和娱乐休闲当中。 \n来源： American Psychiatric Association ，2013 脑瘫会越来越严重吗？ 脑瘫是非进行性的，也就是脑损伤不会一直加重。在幼儿时期需要及早接受康复干预，虽然不能完全彻底改变，但却可以显著降低功能障碍的影响。 脑瘫的康复干预建议咨询医院或康复机构的专业人士。 脑瘫人士可能遇到的挑战脑瘫个体表现不同，且临床分型复杂：有些在出生时或出生数天即可发现，也有些是在出生数月后才被父母发现。一些重度脑瘫的个体，可能需要辅助器具协助行走，或者可能终身难以行走、在生活方面需要较多的支持；一些轻度脑瘫的个体，经过康复锻炼可以自主行走，可能只是姿势不同于普通人。 智力发育迟缓约有52%的个体存在不同程度的智力障碍感染\n\n容易反复呼吸道\n\n及消化道感染，尿液\n\n滞留可能导致\n\n膀胱感染\n情绪及行为障碍许多个体存在情绪障碍，如爱哭、任性、易激动、情绪不稳定、个性较强、固执等。另外，有些人经常伴有兴奋多动、注意力不集中、强迫动作及自我孤立行为等\n感知觉障碍包括知觉、认知障碍、 \n视觉障碍(28%) 、听觉障碍(12%)等\n日常生活照料“心智障碍者家庭支持计划”的愿景目标\n\n探索创新性、系统性解决方案，推动从家庭改变到社会改变。从小家到大家，促进心智障碍者家庭生活福祉构建和社会融入。聚水成川，点亮生命，让心智障碍者家庭不孤单、不绝望！ \n很多脑瘫儿童入读幼儿园/学校的一个对脑瘫人士的支持合理便利\n融合必须要有相应的支持与合理便利，对于进入幼儿园/学校的脑瘫儿童，父母需要跟学校和老师充分沟通，为孩子建立起有效的支持系统，并推动学校为孩子提供必要的合理便利，如： \n1.班级所在的楼层和位置尽可能安排在一层，最近的厕所可以进行无障碍改造，修建缓坡道等，尽可能减少物理环境的限制。 \n2.父母不要对老师隐瞒孩子的状况，比如孩子偶尔有癫痫发作，家长应如实告知，这样老师可以在平时给予孩子较多的关注，即使发生特殊情况也有所预料和准备。 \n3.父母可考虑借助当地家长组织的资源，入校进行校园文化建设活动，从大环境上给孩子创造接纳、友好的氛围。 \n合理便利是指根据具体需要，在不造成过度或不当负担的情况下，进行必要和适当的修改和调整，以确保残疾人在与其他人平等的基础上享有或行使一切人权和基本自由。来源：联合国《残疾人权利公约》 \n\u0007 \n|北京市海淀区融爱融乐心智障碍者家庭支持中心丰台小区全国各地心智障碍者家庭资源中心联系方式\n感谢水滴公益的战略支持了解更多心智障碍领域信息扫码关注晓更基金会，

原家庭作为残障孩子赖以生存的一个系统在他们的成长中有无可替代的重要独特作用。许多的理论研究、相关政策改革和实践充分地证明了父母和家庭对孩子一生的重要性。对于有不同发展需求的残障的孩子来说尤为如此。哈佛大学法学院残障发展项目始终重视家庭支持,在过去的近10年中,该项目从通过促进家校结合和伙伴关系的建立试点项目及家长及其代表组织的能力和支持系统建设各方面持续地开展工作,借助项目的国际学术交流平台,客观尊重和了解国内的实际情况和需求,以联合国《残疾人权利公约》为基准,从提升对残障的意识入手,与许多家长、老师、以及其他和家长工作相关的各个方面一起,通过各种专业活动,希望增进社会、家庭以及个人对家庭支持重要性的认识。这本手册,正是一系列工作的其中一个重要部分。 本手册的目的在于以提高对残障的认识为核心,通过阐述家庭支持的基本观点,分析家庭支持系统建设的要素、家长组织的作用和介绍家庭支持的先进案例,期待在提升对家庭支持的重要性的认识和方法上给读者带来一些启示和帮助。我们把手册的重点放在提高认识上面,是因为,正确的认识指导家长给孩子和家庭做正确的选择,对残障和个人及其家庭的生活持平常的心态,对生活怀稳固的热情,对生命和权利怀敬畏的心。在具体的相关知识和方法的介绍方面,我们采取启发式。毋庸置疑,我们每一位家长都是智慧和力量的源泉,而这些力量和智慧的有机、有序、有效结合才能为孩子和家庭赢得更好的支持。我们的手册,不仅是为了传递和分享,更是为了对话、激发、汇集。 残障人的平等发展、参与和贡献,每个残障人和他们的家庭的尊严和生活品质,一个融合、接纳和尊重的社会环境离不开家长共同的努力,更离不开社会对家庭作为一个系统的重要性的认识和支持!家庭系统中的每个人都和其他人休威相关。我们也希望以此手册告诉家长和社会,家长不能孤单地承担支持和教养孩子的使命,也不能被动地等待,更不能放弃。各方需要从系统保障家长参与政策的研究、制定和实施多层面入手,同时搭建以家长为重要伙伴、以家庭支持为核心的专业和社会服务系统支持家庭,为家长赋能,才能给残障人最初始、适时和长久的支持,才能保证残障人的家庭能够和他们一起共同发展。 \n在编写本手册过程中,我们广泛深入地听取家长和残障人及其双方代表机构的智慧和经验,汲取了中外学者在有关家长支持方面的先进理论和实践荟萃,在此,我们向在手册的编写的过程中给予过我们支持和帮助的各方表达真挚的感谢。 \n这个过程是我们不断提高对家长支持的重要性进一步认识的过程,同时也是我们见证家长及其代表机构丰富的经验和智慧以及蕴含的巨大能量的过程。在这个过程中,家长支持孩子的宝贵生命历程,不离不弃的坚持,千回百转的突破,无时无刻不在感动和激励着我们。也借此机会,向家长们表达我们的敬意! \n崔凤鸣博士哈佛大学法学院残障发展项目\n2015年12 8 18B \n给家长的支持手册好\nত ই 导读ا \n本手册共分四个部分,分别从有关残障的观念意识、家庭支持的法律保障、实践和意义、家长组织和家长参与以及倡导的先进案例呈现等四个方面给读者分享和家庭支持相关的重要议题。 \n第一部分题为“残障”不是悲剧,包括三节。第一节“悲剧”从何而来和读者一起讨论家庭在有关残障的意识方面的主要纠结和态度观念方面常见的误区。这些误区可能是我们不经意就置身其中的。指出他们,也许可以帮助我们意识到更多。发现误区是解决问题的关键;第二节了解残障、还原事实从联合国《残疾人权利公约》第八条入手讲述提高对残障的认识的重要性和法律依据,回顾概念的演变和阐述有关残障的主要模式及其影响;第三节共同改变,展望《公约》带来的改变的力量,强调从家庭开始提高对残障的认识的重要性,提倡从家庭到社会的观念改变。 第二部分是关于家庭支持的法律保障、实践和意义,包括三节。第一节家庭支持的理论和现实依据,简要给读者介绍了家庭支持的定义、实现家庭支持的有效途径和家长在相关政策倡导方面的重要作用。第二节《公约》与家庭的权利和家庭支持,简要叙述了《公约》中和家庭相关的重要内容,以及家长在促进《公约》的落实方面的作用。第三节从知识到行动,就家庭做关心的、残障孩子生涯发展中的重大问题,分主题启发式地给读者列举出一些核心问题,供家长和家长组织思考和规划项目的参考。 \n第三部分是关于家长组织,包括四节。第一节讲到家长组织的作用和专业发展,从家长组织的种类和特点出发,概括了家长组织的综合作用。第二节总结了和家长组织相关的各种关系和多方合作,从各方向简要进行阐述多方合作的重要性。第三节介绍了家长组织进行家庭支持的途径和特点,提出启发性的建议和意见。 \n第四部分是家长和组织倡导的先进案例介绍。这些案例都是从国内挑选的,目的是给大家呈现身边切实的努力,达到举一反三的效果,让每个人从自己家庭、孩子和机构的需求和特点出发,认识到自觉自愿倡导和改变的力量。 \n这样一本功能性的手册目的在于激发家庭的智慧和能量和提高对家庭支持的重要意义的共识,希望能够对读者有帮助。 \no 2 \no ou \n有! \noon 录\n序1 \n导读2

\n一、面对孩子的残障“望子成龙,望女成凤”是生活在中国社会里的每位父母对子女的期盼。当孩子被诊断为“终身残疾” 、 “无可救药”初始甚至相当长一段岁月,大多数的父母面对残障孩子,在期盼和现实的落差中,都要经历震惊、抗拒、恐惧、怀疑、愧疚、痛苦、沮丧、无奈、无助甚至无望等一系列的心路历程。这样的挣扎往往不会止于家庭的内部。当家庭不得不面对社会的时候,残障者的父母还常常惧怕亲友和外人的议论、质疑或排斥等负面行为和态度,不知道该如何面对孩子和外界。家长在深感那些持负面态度和行为的人十分冷漠、无知或狭隘的同时,也无法克服自己心中的自卑和怀疑。随着时间的推移,这种内外交困的处境可能导致父母自身的无助感,并且将其潜移默化地融入到对孩子的态度和做法之中。 \n家庭,尤其是父母,对孩子的残障的反应是及其复杂的,常见的反应有: \n“孩子怎么会是这样?是哪里出的问题? ” \n“为什什么偏偏是我们?我们破错了什么让这两的霉事在我们头上？难道这是前世罪业A生的报应? \n“劝这种孩子,我们还能有什什么指望和期多? \n\n\"孩子將夹堡罪我父母怎么办? \" \n\n“这样的孩子济着也是受罪,不如死了好,反而解脱了\"和孩子-起死了吧,一7百了! \n\n“我们的一生算是让他/她)發7 。 \n\n“这个孩子-生就发了,我得养他/她)一辈子\n\"我7/父母/死了孩子该怎么办?産来實他/她/?一定要死在孩子的后面这对我其他正常孩子太不么平了,要他们生来面动额外的负想、尴t 、羞容… . \n无论怎么想,父母这一身份无可推卸和替代。饱含着责任、义务和爱,身为父母,我们最终可能是因为无奈回归到这样一个现实: “不管怎么样,这都是一个生命,都是我的孩子” 。痛苦之余家庭开始寻找解决问题的办法。在面对子女的残障时,可以说绝大多数残障人的父母,都曾长期抱有过一丝的希望,期盼子女能够通过求医问药出现被治愈的奇o \n迹或有相当程度的改善,或在足够的康复训练后变“正常” 。我们的残障孩子,也伴随着家长沉重的叹息和义无反顾的“正常化”之路中,认知和固化自身“不正常” 、 “病态”的悲剧身份。 \n那么,我们是否曾经认真的思考过: 什么是龙,什么是凤?成龙成凤对一个生命来说意味着什么? \n什么是孩子的幸与不幸,成功与失败?这些和他们的残壁有什什么直接关系? \n低S室值和不断地否定对残借孩子带来什么样的影响？ 残壁到底是怎么一回事?影响我定义残堂的标准是什么?这种标准的依据在哪里？是什么原因导致残壁成了家限里和心中的压力、负坦、不正常、羞M甚至绝望? \no \n社会环境会给家庭看待残壁的态度起到什么影响? \n面防残障,我们应当持什么现念和态度才会对我的孩子和家庭有益? \n要理解和探寻这些问题,我们首先需要了解影响家庭认识、态度和决策的几个重大领域。 二、有关残障认识残障人作为一个群体的所处的困境不容乐观。即使他们中间的少数会有社会定义的成功的经历和发展结果,而这些人会被看作是“楷模” ,也就是说这些成功的例子很少,很突出,不是一种普遍现象。这在很大的程度上折射出环境对残障的认识和接纳程度。处在这种环境中的家庭受到很大影响。家长对残障的认识和态度以及在孩子不同成长阶段所做的相关决策,起了很重要作用,可以说甚至给孩子的一生带来不可估量的影响,包括孩子对自己的定位和对外界的态度和反映,不同阶段给孩子的专业支持对孩子所能产生的成效等等。这不是危言耸听。我们大致从以下几点便能清楚地看到: \n1·大量的、越来越多的有关残障人家庭在他们生涯发展不同阶段的作用的研究与实践; \n\n2.世界各国立法的改革中对家庭的权利和义务重视程度的不断提高; \n\n3.在涉及到残障权利保护的各项事物和工作中对家长的角色作用的不断重视; \n\n4,家长的权利意识和自我意识的觉醒和家长机构的快速发展壮大等等。 \n因此,了解影响残障人及其家庭对残障的意识和态度的因素成为关键的问题。处在一定社会环境中的个人和家庭,对待残障的认识、态度和决策行为意识通常受三个方面的制给家长的支持手册\n4 \n7 \nourn on ه \nه \n5 约1.社会环境中的文化价值所导致的对残障的起因的认识视角的主导模式。这种主导模式直接影响对残障的界定和对残障者的认识和态度。这个问题我们接下来将具体阐述。在这里我们需要强调的是,在过去很长时期,把这些文化价值观放置在有关残障的实践领域导致很多问题,尤其是当残障人极少出现在公众领域和参与社会的情况下,公众对残障人的直观了解不多,甚至极少,因而对残障人的认识界于主观臆断或想象层面。以人权的框架代替文化价值,是从根本上改善残障人状况的出发点; \n2.对残障者生存和发展的期望值。比如对残障人的生存和发展的期望值应当抱怎么的期望值?应该高还是低?取决高和低的因素是什么?是否对他们持和其他人一样的期望值。值得指出的是当社会以及公众对残障人的期望值仅仅因为其身心功能的不同特点和差异降低时,就会影响到资源的调配和回应性措施的力度和跨度,由此导致对这个群体的发展的制度性的制约和限制; \n3.对残障者适当的社会角色的认识。这个问题主要涉及对残障人在社会各个方面的参与责任和义务认识,比如他们所担当的角色是否应当受残障的影响?社会体制如何保护或排除他们的角色作用?体制的设置如何强化或改变社会、家庭和个人对残障人社会角色的认识,等等。这种认识影响残障人享有什么样赖于生存和发展的机会、资源和支持,是否能承担和实现基本的角色作用等等。 \n这三大领域相互渗透,相互影响,当负面成分和影响占主导的情况下,不仅使残障人及其家庭处于绝对不利的处境,而且反过来影响残障人及其家庭对自身的负面认识和行动,形成无形、循环往复的和强有力的恶性循环。 三、常见的误区各种因素的作用,使得家长在对待残障孩子、家长自身和家庭的认识产生很多误区。家长对待残障孩子方面的误区普遍有: \n1·认为孩子的残障是不正常的病态,要四处奔走,求医问药,治好孩子,不然孩子就没希望; \n2.夸大残障孩子的局限和不能,忽视他们的特点、差异、优势和独特性; 3.不懂得肯定、鼓励和开发残障孩子的潜能和发现和发挥他们优势; \n4,片面认为孩子有残障就能力差,值得可怜,便过度呵护、照顾; \n5,替代孩子完成家务,认为这样省时、省力、省心,致使家长付出不必要辛苦,孩子也失去了日常发展和养成适应性生活技能的宝贵机会; \n৪ 6,把孩子的语言训练、认知提高或精细动作训练和他们的成长过程割裂开来,或者盲目地进行个别不适当训练,忽略甚至搁置孩子的全人发展; \n7.过度关注孩子的功能补偿,忽视孩子有好奇心、求知欲或独特兴趣; 8.重视孩子特定时期的训练,缺乏长远计划; \n9.顾及现当下孩子的状况,忽略其一生全程发展的需求,短期目标和长期目标脱节; \n10,忽略孩子可能有的独特交流方式和表达需求以及和其他家庭成员的良好关系建立和培养,忽视孩子情绪变化和情意态度和身心健康; \n11.在社交、社区和学校等场所遮掩孩子的残障; \n12,因残障降低对孩子的期望值,从而降低或放弃对孩子的投入; \n13,认为融合就是和普通人待一起,因此认为孩子残障程度轻的就应该去融合,和“正常人”待一块儿,程度重的就该隔离起来。 \n家长对待自身和家庭方面的误区普遍有: 1.有些家长认为残障孩子是自己的“宿命”和悲剧,无法改变和逃避,断定由此生活不会再有快乐和精彩; \n\nه \n2.家长对孩子有负罪感,常常生活在愧疚中,很难摆脱; 3.选择为孩子拼命挣钱、攒钱,竭力想办法为孩子安排生活,期望为孩子提供未来生活保障; \n4.家长选择不同被动方式以求解脱自己内心的困扰,对孩子的教养不报希望; \n5.家长尽量把很多的委屈和不甘都闷在心里,夫妻之间不相互倾诉,也不和外人交流; 6,夫妻之间主观认为孩子的障碍原因由对方引起,埋怨、指责,或逃避,导致家庭关系受影响; 7.偏信专家误导,对孩子所获得的服务缺乏全面的评估; \n\n8.认为残障是导致家庭各方面问题的主要原因; \n\n9.逃避和推卸责任,放弃抚养权,抛弃甚至残害孩子; \n\n10.寄托于孩子进托养机构等类似地方,忽略孩子对家庭和多元支持的需求。 \n这些误区,说明我们的孩子和家庭处于一种危机的状况。促进对残障的深入了解,还原残障的本来面目,是帮助孩子和家庭走出困境的第一步。 \nا ១ \nه อ 第二节了解残瞳,还原事实相关于残障和残障人的概念和称谓一直在发生变化。那么什么是残障呢?残障是过去的十年中出现频率越来越多的词。与之相应出现的还有身心障碍,障碍等词,这些词的内涵和外延伴随着残障权利保护的进程不断演变,得益于社会各界,尤其是残障人本身和他们的家庭在努力消除对残障人称谓中的负面含义,维护他们的尊严和权利的过程中的倡导和推动。 \n在这部分我们主要讨论三个方面的问题:了解残障的必要性;有关残障的称谓和概念的演变;共同改变。 一、了解残障的必要性从以上列举的误区和对残障的强烈反应,我们不难看出,整个社会,包括家长,对残障存在很多误解,歧视和偏见。这就是为什么2008年生效的联合E 《残疾人权利公约》 ( 《公约》 ,下同)第八条特别强调要提高认识,而且特别要提高家长的认识。 \n10 第八条“提高认识”的规定如下: 一.缔约国承诺立即采取有效和适当的措施,以便: \n\n(一)提高整个社会,包括家庭,对残疾人的认识,促进对残疾人权利和尊严的尊重; (二)在生活的各个方面消除对残疾人的定见、偏见和有害做法,包括基于性别和年龄的定见、偏见和有害做法; \n\n(三)提高对残疾人的能力和贡献的认识。 \n二.为此目的采取的措施包括: \n(-)发起和持续进行有效的宣传运动,提高公众认识,以便: \n1,培养接受残疾人权利的态度; \n2,促进积极看待残疾人,提高社会对残疾人的了解; \n3.促进承认残疾人的技能、才华和能力以及他们对工作场所和劳动力市场的贡献; \n在各级教育系统中培养尊重残疾人权利的态度,包括从小在所有儿童中培养这种态度; \n三)鼓励所有媒体机构以符合本公约宗旨的方式报道残疾人; (四推行了解残疾人和残疾人权利的培训方案。 \n仔细阅读,我们便能发现,针对家庭对残障的认识, 《公约》第八条清楚地告诉我们-F重ЕЛ: \n1.残障人和其他人相比虽然有显著的身心差异和特点,但他们有作为人所固有的、不可剥夺和侵犯的权利、尊严和价值; \n2.他们作为一个群体普遍遭受各种偏见和歧视的损害; 3,他们有能力对社会作出贡献(或许是以不同的方式),然而社会对他们的贡献认识错误足,这些错的认识需要得到纠正; \n4,全面深刻地纠正相关于残障的观念错误,提高认识,是国家的责任和义务和社会的共同努力; \n5.要采取有效的措施,特别关注提高家庭对残障、能力、参与和贡献的认识。 了解残障,提高认识,就是要促进对残障人权利、尊严和价值的尊重,消除对他们的偏见,提高对他们的能力和贡献的认识,进而提供平等的机会、融合的环境和适当的支持,让他们的能力得到发展和施展的空间。残障人的家庭和社区生活以及社会发展每一个方面都离不开残障人、家庭和公众对残障的正确认识。没有对残障人的正确认识,残障人及其家庭成员的身份认同,角色作用,所能享有的资源和服务,参与社会的机会和能力发展及社会保障和权利义务等各个方面都要受到普遍和深刻的影响,对个人、家庭和社会都是不利的。 二、有关概念的演变\nM残度，到疾，再到残璧、壁碍… … … 我们都知道,用来形容人的身心功能的损伤和差异的称谓和概念并非一成不变。在过去的一个多世纪中,在残障这个词出现之前,有关的综合概念和称谓变化主要出现过两个词:残废和残疾。残废作为一个正式的称谓基本上经历了相当长的历史时期,至20世纪80年代末变为残疾。相对于称谓的积极变化来说,其所代表的概念的定义的变化要更缓慢一些。在过去的十年间,残障,身心障碍或障碍等词越来越频繁地出现的公众的视野,自发地取代“残疾”这个词。这样一种新的变化反映出,随着人们对残障的本质的认识不断提高,随着时代的进步,观念的变化,人们不断地努力探索和追求更科学、积极和全面的称谓和概念。这种追求的过程也主要反映了残障人及其家庭渴望社会能够还原残障和残障者一个真实的面目。称谓的变化不能缺失对其内涵的定义的丰富和发展。因此,概念的安\nه \n更新,体现的是时代的进步和要求,挑战的是人的观念,促成的是尊重差异的、对人人有益的融合社会环境。 残度度? 曾经在相当长的一段时间,残废,简言之残既废,被普遍和正式地用来形容和称谓一个群体所具有的不同身心功能局限特征。顾名思义,在社会背景下,残废这个名称作为一个昭然若揭的定论,断定“残废者”仅仅因其身体、心理或认知的某些差异或限制,便被视为废物和悲剧。然而社会的不断进步使得残废这个词语和概念本身涵盖的负面性越来越凸显,越来越不合时宜,自80年代起残废逐步被残疾所取代。 残,E队E病或不正常？ “残疾”去除了“残废”中的“废”字,在语言的文明和观念上进了一步。然而, “残疾人在其生活的社会背景下,被视为病人和缺陷的人,处于不正常状态,主要需要接受治疗、区别安置与特殊的照顾。在这种认知下, “残疾者”可能不一定被称作是“废”的,但人们依然普遍认为他们的种种处境和面临的障碍主要由其自身的“疾病”与“缺陷”直接导致,是个人经历,个人和家庭或者通过绝对的医疗使其“正常” ,或者通过自身的努力克服和超越“不正常” 。其中一少部分人通过付出比所谓的“正常人”或“健全人”更多的努力,获得相同的成就(很多时候被赞美为“自强不息” 、 “身残志坚” ) 。外界对此类事件的聚焦点通常在于这些人是如何和自己的所谓“缺陷”和“不能”抗争,然后超越,殊不知,他们努力克服的其实往往不是自己的差异,而是各种外界障碍。在“残疾”这种语境中,社会普遍着眼于身体、感官或心智障碍者的功能差异和局限,着眼于基于物质和技术条件给他们提供一些特别救助、治疗、干预,以便尽量让他们能够适应社会。这个群体所处的环境因素,尤其是主观因素,在这个语境中缺失。 营，公人损伤或得制+环境和态度堂碍当下,质疑“残疾”这个称谓的片面性及其效应的呼声越来越响,人们已经开始顺应种先进视角的发展和改变。在这个过程中,一个重大事件就是《公约》的出台及其在各缔约国和履约国的影响。 《公约》指出: “残疾是一个演变中的概念,残疾是伤残者和阻碍他们在与其他人平等的基础上充分和切实地参与社会的各种态度和环境障碍相互作用所产生的结果” (序言,五) 。展开来说,这句话首先是说“残疾”这个概念不是一成不变的,而是不断演绎变化的。其次是说, “残疾”是一种由处于某种限制的个体和外部环境相互作用而产生的综合结果,而不是单方面由个体的功能差异所决定的现象。再次,相互作用的双方包括有功能差异的人和他们所处的充满障碍的环境和存在的各种态度和观念;最后,相互作用发生在享有平等权利的、有功能差异的人和其他人一起充分和切实地参与社会的过程中,他们的参与决定相互作用的结果,进而决定概念的客观和全面性。这就是“残障“这个概念所集中体现的含义,残障即显著差异和特点+各种态度和环境障碍。这样客观看待残障的视角给我们确定解决残障相关问题的重心带来了变革性的指引,即还原人的显著差异和特点为人类多样性一部分的事实,改变态度,提高认识,消除环境障碍,保障平等参与和贡献。 \n这个过程不是一帆风顺的。因为观念和态度是根深蒂固的,所以改变的发生往往是个漫长的过程,需要一种普遍的自觉和主动意识,需要自我的挑战和环境的改善,需要各方合力。在这个过程的背后,有几个密切相关的问题值得深思: 纠结残壁的称请以识是因为这个词所代表的群体过于敏感？ 为什么时常会有“公众用残疾这个词残障在身没有负面的意思,何比那么介意”等等的反应? \n名称和概念在整个社会结构建构中起着什么作用？ \n追求概念的进步所遇到的主要壁碍是什么？ \n你我携带和加深这些壁码吗? ？ \n归根到底，我们了解残壁并且愿意了解吗？ \n对于用什么词来替代“残疾” ,不同的人持不同的意见, “残障”是其中的一个提的比较多的选择,还有“障碍”等,争议聚焦在于是否应当使用“残“这个字。有人说“残”是一种客观状态,无需遮盖或回避,应以平常心看待,但也有人极力主张避免使用“残”字。这样的斟酌本身就是一件好事,澄清是非,促成了解,改变认识。我们所追求的是一个朴实、直白、坦然、真实、积极和客观的词,但我们的追求不止于称谓本身,更是一个相对准确的定义,它能够既体现对功能差异和局限的平常心,又能够明确地涵盖环境中的障碍对一个群体的影响。这个定义的清楚界定能够有助于相关法律、政策和实践全面、一致和切实保障这个群体的权利和义务,从而敦促一个尊重差异的、对人人有益的社会环境的改善和认识提升。 \n综上所述,问题的焦点在于残障这个词语的内涵是指: 绝对的个问题还是个人经历在社会中的折射; \n它是一成不变的个状态,还是不断演变的社会构成如何看待功能差异和局限;是竭力消除差异、纠正局图,还是建立成果为导向的文持体系,促进多样性发展\n残微所包含的因素中，那些是相时固定的，那丝是可以不断变化的； ，解决相关键问题的着跟点应当成在哪里， \n\nFod \n残障是“悲剧” 、病态” 、 \"不正常”等观点的由来是什么,这些现点给人、实و \nا ه 庭和社会带来什么后果？ 这些问题是我们思考相关概念的出发点和依据,需要引起包括家长在内的所有人的深思。科学地说,残障无疑是个演变的事物,体现的是一个从强调个人缺陷的绝对性然后施以纠正或补偿,到逐步开始客观全面地思考在社会的框架下功能的局限最终所能呈现的综合结果,以及这种结果在个人和社会两方面的体现的过程。这个过程伴随的是态度和观念的改变和社会无障碍环境的不断改善。 三、残障的主要模式在残障概念演变的过程中,有很多的模式在起着作用。其中最主要的是看待残障的个人模式和社会模式。我们为什么要把看待残障的主要观点或视角归结为模式呢?是因为模式是把理念和想法变成实践和行动的路径,也就是说这些视角在一定的规律下对现实和实践产生稳固的、持续的影响。有关残障的模式起的正是这样的作用。因此,模式绝非只是动动嘴皮子,随意转转脑子,动动心思,无关紧要,可以不必在意。相反,一种主导的模式, -直在潜移默化地渗透、影响,无处不在,不知不觉中产生主导的功效和力量,其影响力能渗透到各个角落,包括相关理论和实践。 \n看待残障的模式和残障的概念密切相关,因此,在介绍模式之前,我们先简要列出残障的定义通常包含五个方面: \n1.残障的属性,即残障是个人悲剧还是社会问题; 2.残障的构成,即仅仅指个体的功能差异、局限和特点还是需要包括个体所处的环境因素及其作用; \n3.残障的结果归因,即残障个体的状况责任应当归咎于哪里,是个人及其家庭,还是社会; \n4,有关残障的对策,即面对残障,解决问题的出发点和结果是什么,是纠正个人功能差异,还是改善环境; \n5,残障人的角色定位,即残障人在相关残障的事物中是被动接受的客体还是核心的主体。 \n以上五个方面相互联系,相互作用。对每个方面的答案的不同选择,是确定各个残障模式的分水岭。 \n14 个模式残障的个人模式由残障的个人悲剧理论所支撑,即指因为不幸的、难以预测的事件发生在了个人的身上,造成个人的所谓“缺陷”和“非正常”状态,个人也主要因此过着痛苦和悲剧式的生活。既然是悲剧,那就要尽一切所能避免、消除,或正常化。这种模式把功能局限和差异同“残障”这个概念片面等同起来,自然地定位残障为个人问题,由此推论是这些“缺陷”和“不正常”导致残障个人的不利处境和悲剧性命运,而通过医学手段和干预消除或减轻残障、尽可能使之正常化是解决问题的出发点、途径和主要目标。 “残障”即个人缺陷和不正常即个人悲剧的观点长期起主导作用,通过媒体、语言、文化价值观、政策和教育实践等渠道渗透到社会的各个角落。这个问题不难理解。试想一下有多少残障人成立家庭选择要自己的孩子的时候得到这样的建议: “为什么要把自己的悲剧延续到孩子身上呢? ”类似的想法和说法在现实中比比皆是,多数是必然的、出于善意的忠告和表达,得到很大认同。人们在对残障排斥、不了解或没有机会多了解的情况下,以很多的假设主观臆断残障人和他们的生活。这种模式的影响下,残障人作为群体被自然地被划分为相对于主流的“另类” ,区别对待。他们通常被看作权利的客体,家庭和社会的负担,主要需要被动的接受救治、慈善、怜悯和爱心的对象。这种模式的长期主导通常导致的是使基于残障的歧视、偏见、隔离乃至发展机会的丧失等现象长期存在。 这种模式涵盖一系列涉及残障的重大问题。具体说来,首先是解决有关残障问题的出发点和侧重点。因为个人模式把眼光绝对地聚焦在个人的功能局限和差异上,并且把这些差异看作为“病态” ,所以把解决残障相关问题的手段主要聚焦在医学上,也就是说,医学的干预被当作是解决残障的主要策略和手段,强调对残障人竭力进行“缺陷”补偿,期待他们从所谓的“非正常”状态转变到和其他人一样的“正常”状态,从而获得进入“主流”的资格,否则就做照顾性质的特殊、隔离式的安置,将他们排除在系统之外。 其次,这种模式渗透到政策的制定和实施,资源的整合和分配,环境的建设和社会分工等各个方面,使得残障人作为一个群体普遍遭受社会结构性歧视。社会系统各个方面的隔离和排除性安置具有相当的合理性,被普遍认为最符合残障人的特殊性和需要,甚至在这种环境中的残障人及其家长都这么认为,严重影响他们认识和表达自身需求和愿望的能力和机会。因为这种模式要求残障人被动地适应不考虑他们特点和需求的环境,所有环境的设计和建设没有他们的主动参与,障碍重重。 再次,这种模式顺理成章地决定解决残障问题的专业发展和团队建设。解决残障问题的专业系统往往主要由医生、理疗师、特殊教育老师等以功能补偿为目的的人员为主导,专业的研究和实践主要着眼于“缺陷”矫正等方面的研发。家庭也就自然而然、浑然不觉地把一线希望都寄托在治“病”上。把残障这个纷繁复杂的社会事宜主要依赖于从事医治和矫正的专业人员来解决是个人模式对解决残障问题的一个很大误导。 \n其结果是,在这个模式下,社会对残障人产生刻板印象,他们的能力和表现能力的多样方式被长期忽略。社会实践在这种态度的误导下,不知不觉地把残障人造就成依附和没有能力的“负担” ,而残障人进一步被社会环境致弱致残的情况不断强化他们的悲剧色彩和“缺陷”状态,形成观念和态度方面的恶性循环,不知不觉中固化社会、家庭和个人好\nه 对残障者的刻板印象和对残障人整体的偏见和歧视,使得这个群体的负面处境广泛得到合理化存在。在这个过程中,残障人所处的社会环境中普遍存在的障碍和看待残障的负面态度往往被忽略。从以上原因可以看出,不断地反思对待残障的视角是发现问题和寻找解决残障问题的方向的关键。 社会模式与残障的个人模式相对应的是残障的社会模式。社会模式定位残障作为个体和社会互动的存在现象,是社会的构成。它并不否认残障者的功能局限和不同特点及带来的挑战,但确认残障是功能局限和社会环境相互作用的综合结果,唯有客观地透过社会和文化的框架才能全面了解和定义残障。社会模式还原残障是人类常态、多元化和多样性的一部分,而不再是一种缺陷、悲剧或疾病。这种模式指出:有关残障的问题是社会对个人局限的回应所造成的,环境中的障碍和错误态度导致残障人作为一个群体不必要的隔离和边缘化,认为把残障人作为群体的处境归咎于个体的功能局限是片面的。社会模式告诉我们,残障者所面临的障碍并非他们的差异和局限,而是社会没有做好接纳他们的准备,没有从一开始考虑到他们特点和需要。社会原本仅是由大多数所谓“主流的” 、 “标准的” 、 “正常的”人按照他们的需求和习惯构建的,缺乏对被边缘化的少数群体特点和多样性的考量。所以在社会模式下,残障人不再是只能靠通过“自强不息”来克服自己面临的障碍,跻身于所谓“主流社会” ,而是与社会各界一起共同参与,通过完善和调整既有的规则和环境,修正负面态度,消除各种障碍,以保证残障者各项平等权利的实现。 残障的社会模式起源于1976年英国肢体障碍反隔离联盟发表的《残障的根本原则》 。这个文献指出: “残障是把我们(残障人)不必要地隔离和排除在全面参与社会之外的过程中在我们的局限之上额外的附加。 ”最先按照这个文献提出的重要观点给残障的社会模式命名的英国专家Michael Oliver说过这样一句经典和发人深省的话: “相关研究的目的不在于把没腿的变正常,而是营造一种社会环境,使得有没有腿都是不相关的问题。这句话一语道破残障的社会模式下有关残障事物的切入点。 \n具体来说,首先,残障既然是社会构成,那么社会应当承担消除障碍,改变落后观念,维护残障人权利的义务和责任,完善和修订相关法律,切实保障实施,提升残障人和家长及其代表机构作为残障事物主体的认识以及进行有关残障的持续公众教育等; \n其次,在这样的模式下,关注问题的出发点是态度、观念和环境的障碍。衡量这些障碍的依据就是残障人的特点和平等参与的需求,以及对他们特点和需求的尊重,不断推进环境和态度无障碍建设,促成一个对人人有益的融合社会; \n再次,残障的问题就应该在多学科和跨学科的专业发展路径下,由包括各类专业人员在内的综合系统来承担,以残障人为主体,以他们的独特发展为目标,在尊重和了解残障群体的特性和需求的科学基础上,做系统的支持,用平等的机会和保障让残障人享有独立、有尊严的生活,允许他们以各种不同的方式和能力表达、参与和贡献,切忌削足适履。 综上所述,残障的模式的影响是深远和广泛的,涉及到法律和政策的制定和实施,公众对残障和残障群体的认识,残障群体及其家庭对自身和环境的认识,服务和资源的分配和提供,以及专业系统的发展和专业人员团队的角色作用定位和相互关系的建立。社会模式在看待问题的本质和思考解决问题的途径上面给我们带来不同的、有挑战的视角。社会需要的是看待和解决残障事物的重心转移,即从眼睛只盯着个人的功能差异或局限这些稳定的状态转向着眼于充满障碍的社会结构的问题。因此,不应该把涉及到残障人的教育、就业、社会发展等重大问题割裂开来,而是系统研究和解决。 \ne ou \nuo o \nrn o 给家长的支持手册\nワ \nอ 第三节共同改变\n一、 《公约》带来的切实改变残障的社会模式自20世纪80年代被提出之后,一直弱弱地游离在学界的讨论中,直到以残障的社会模式为框架、以人权为准则的联合国《残疾人权利公约》的出台和相继在各履约国的推广和落实,政府的支持,残障人、家长及其机构的积极响应,残障的社会模式才开始产生社会改变。正如前联合国秘书长安南先生2006年12月指出: “ 《公约》是部卓越的、有前瞻性的文件,在着重残障人权利的同时,也针对社会这个整体。在残障中生活A1,往往被看作尴尬的。他们充其量是接受居高临下的怜悯和救济的对象。在书面上,他们和其他人享有同等的权利,但在现实中,他们的机会却被想当然的剥夺了。 \n《公约》所强调的概念演变以及能够带来的社会变化是我们所共同期待的。概念演变的过程同时逐步促成以下几种主要变化,这些变化也是我们不断地强调的: \n1.残障从主要被看作是个人的悲剧和问题,主要依赖于医疗的干预和纠正还原为社会构成,需要从社会的层面来综合对待; \n2.随之而来的残障人身份的变化,从被当作病人、不正常或有缺陷的人和需要被动地领受救济和福利安置的客体,还原为人类多样性的一部分,成为参与和引领与自己相关事务的主体,有作为平等的公民参与社会事务的权利和义务。他们由被动到主动,从依赖到独立自主,从领受救济到参与贡献,于个人、家庭和社会都是相得益彰的好事; \n3.解决残障相关问题的专业系统的定位变化,由主要针对个人的缺陷补偿的医疗专业系统为主逐步开始向从残障的社会性这个主要层面来进行全面的专业系统构建转变。 \n4,从内容上来说,残障问题成为跨学科、多学科的领域,向长期忽略这个议题的社会各个方面渗透,成为人类研究和实践的有机组成部分。 \n残障概念演变的背后反映着时代所蕴涵和追求的价值观,足以引起我们的反思: 抛弃的时代-牺牲个体、弱肉强食\n怜悯的时代--施舍、歧视福利的时代--养护、边缘化\n经济的时代-技能、竞争权利的时代-以人为本、公平正义二、改变从家庭开始残障是一个演变中的概念。从“残废”到“残疾” ,再到“残障” 、 “障碍”等不断趋于先进的概念,社会在这个过程中,也发生了可喜的变化,从错误地否定残障的价值,到去补偿、纠正这个错误。现如今,我们已经开始意识到,残障并非是一个个体的悲剧,它也不应该被视为让人羞耻的压力和负担。相反,残障之所以会成为悲剧有许多社会环境和观念的因素,进而导致成众多家庭的悲剧。造成诸多悲剧的源头,主要并非残障本身,而是社会看待残障的态度和这种态度导致的社会问题和障碍。在这样的环境中,每个人都受到影响。这样一个由认识的提高带来的环境的改善和障碍的消除,对家庭尤为重要。 家庭是社会构成中最基本的结构系统,家庭的每个成员的状况,都直接影响整个家庭系统。在残障者与社会互动的过程中,扮演十分重要角色的,就是我们的家庭成员,尤其是家长。家长如何看待残障,直接影响到整个家庭氛围和残障孩子如何看待自己,能否接纳自己;孩子的自我意识,将影响各种教育和支持的成效,间接影响到孩子与社会接触过程中的心理与承受力。不可否认,目前我们的社会中充斥着“残疾”甚至“残废”的观念,有些家长也持同样的观念。这种观念,有意无意地流露在日常生活里家长对待残障孩子的态度与行为。这就意味着家长在替自己的孩子感到不公的同时,也在参与和强化这种不公。如果我们将残障的孩子看成是一个问题,一种错误,一个悲剧,并且有意无意地常年将这种情绪带给孩子,诸如面对孩子的长吁短叹,面对孩子的各种假设,甚至是基于孩子残障的赞赏与夸奖,有时候不经意间的一言一行,都有可能给孩子一种暗示或者明言:残障是一件非常不好事情,而你是一个不幸的残障者。这给孩子造成长期的负面影响。 \n因此,要改变残障孩子的不利处境,家长观念的转变至关重要。因为与之最亲近的人,能够一直持续给予其力量的人,就是我们的家长。而最容易给孩子带来伤害的,往往也是我们的家长在有意无意间流露的言行。 \n我们的期望是,社会所构建的环境和规则能充分考虑到个人的特点和多样性,使得每个人都不会因为自己的特点,被迫面临某些障碍,隔离,排斥,污名,导致他们无法在与他人平等的基础上充分享有其权利,参与社会生活。 \n我们相信,在这个过程中,家长的积极行动,无比重要。 三、改变的历程:走向平常心家长对待残障的认识普遍经历从“悲惨”到“坚强”再到“平常心”的历程。有些家长长期停留在面对残障感到悲惨的阶段不能走出来,相当一部分家长内心苦楚但为了孩子和家庭持不能被打垮的态度,少数家长进入平常心状态。这三种状态对家长和家庭来说意味着什么呢？ \n5 7 事件一, 2014年01月28日,广东首个“婴儿安全岛”在广州市社会(儿童)福利院正式投入使用, 3月16日,在试点近50天之际,广州市“婴儿安全岛”试点工作情况通报会宣布暂停试点“婴儿安全岛” ,主要原因是短时间内接收弃婴数量已经超出了福利院承受的极限,需要暂停试点进行总结。 \n事件二,一位母亲,曾是某银行大堂经理,为照顾因早产而脑瘫的两个儿子,不得不辞职在家,耗尽家财为儿治病。 13年后因家庭经济困难,韩群凤于2010年11月20日晚溺毙了双子后服毒欲自杀未遂。 2011年6月28日被东莞市第一人民法院判其故意杀人罪,获刑五年。 事件三,据香港《明报》报道,香港发生一起父亲砍死自闭症儿子的惨案。被街坊称赞是“好爸爸”的59岁蔡姓男子,抚育自闭兼智障的长子15载,蔡某4个月前失业后全职照顾长子,有感自己将踏入花甲之年,担心自己与儿子俱成妻子负累,遂写下遗书,计划砍死长子后自杀,称“对这个家会好的” 。蔡某趁长子熟睡时行凶,继而刎颈寻死,但其后自行报警,自闭儿子最终伤重不治。凶案震动全村,不少老村民表示蔡某一直是好爸爸。 这虽然是三个非常突出的事件,但同时也引发对众多家庭的强烈冲击。我们不幸的看到,即使这些家庭无可避免地要承受难以弥补的痛苦,但依然还是选择义无反顾的弃绝了自己的孩子。在这些事件中,有的发生在内地,有的在香港,有的发生在流动人口群体中,也有的发生在中产家庭里。那么,为什么在背景差异如此悬殊的前提下,只是因为孩子的残障,他们最终的选择却又如此相似?显然,对于这些家庭来说,面对残障的悲痛,远远大于骨肉分离、失去生命和自由等代价。很多人都会觉得这不正是残障给家庭带来的巨大负担吗?进一步来看,从对这些事件的广泛讨论中,我们感受到旁观者对于这些家长的选择的某种理解和趋同,社会各界似乎都在关注和期待着法律和制度在面对这样被“广泛理解”的极端现象出现时,能够“网开一面” 、 “情有可原” 。是的,我们必须深切体会在现实生活中听到的、看到的、感受到的伴随残障一个家庭所承受的困难。但也正是在这些事件中,我们看到残障被作为导致悲惨的因素无限的放大甚至扭曲,导致这些悲剧的其他因素被盲目地淡化或认同。 我们用对性别的态度转变来揭示一些同样的道理。当今,当得知亲人或者朋友刚刚迎来一个新生命的诞生时,人们问的第一个问题可能是“男孩还是女孩? ”答案对于大家来说或许是意味着需要准备什么礼物等等个人喜好和关注点,对孩子来说无关紧要。但是在过去,人们也问同样的问题“男孩还是女孩? ”所不同的是,那个时候,不同的答案可能意味着孩子因为不同的性别,遭遇不同的命运和对待;而这种过去和现在针对生男生女的不同态度和导致的结果,不是因为现在出生的孩子变了,而是人们的观念变了,社会变了对待性别的态度也变了。 与此类似的是,作为残障孩子的家长最关心的问题是“孩子能正常吗? ”很显然,狭义的否定答案会让每个“当事者”倍感挫折。在最终确认孩子的残障后,这个孩子周围的人们开始按照他们想象的一个“不正常”孩子应该有的生活和状态对待他/她,有的直接放弃、有的咬牙坚持,在真正的“挫折”还没到来的那一刻起,人们已经把自己放在了挫折当中。按照自己对“挫折”的反映悲痛着… … 家长常常这样坚强：面对残营的“灾理” ，我只能忍负重上述悲惨的例子,虽然确实能够激起很多残障孩子家长的不同的强烈反应,可能还有不少共鸣,但在现实中,很多家长,在面对突然的变故沉积下来之后,通常都过渡到忍辱负重、无可退缩、坚强地面对孩子残障的硬挺状态。那么,我们该如何看待这种和残障相关的忍辱负重的坚强?它日积月累地给家长、残障孩子和家庭带来什么样的作用? \n要明白这种坚强是怎么一回事,首先应当思考这种忍辱负重似的坚强背后意味着什么。我们趋向于逆着打击的坚强,可能往往是我们对内心对残障不愿接受的脆弱的回避,是我们在和自身对残障的负面认识和面对外界的偏见和歧视的打压较劲,说明我们极力想抗拒残障这个“灾难”和外界的压力前,已经败给了我们不能接受残障和错误地看待残障的态度。因而,忍辱负重似的坚强成了对家长自己、孩子和家庭无声的蚕食、消耗和瓦解。 \n下面是一些常见的例子,可以帮助我们理解这种坚强是一种无奈和缺失。这样的例子还有很多: \n不少家庭火无反顾地投入胜么/年抗战”那象艰苦卓绝的陪孩子康复训练,在社会歧视的夹缝中,影織承坦难以考负的经济压力,常常为无效的“医疗”买单,按到筋疲力尽,但执意不肯果休; \n忽略自己的需求和常态生活,把自己的工作,事业和生活,包括夫妻关系等让位子残障孩子,且x为别无送,孩子可怜,需要自己的牺进\n有些严重和多重残障孩子的父母,令他们更为恐焊的是自己死亡以后,自己的孩子再无依托,寄希望子死在孩子的后面,或者判决自己和孩子的未来. “我一定要在临死之前，将孩子一起带走,以免让孩子在这个世界上受罪。 ” \n在针对其他没有残僻孩子的问题上,父母或者让他们承坦不必要的心里负担,把正常的担当看A额外的牺牲,或者饰绝继续要孩子的打算,以为这样就避免了不么平地疾雄残的病苦给其他的孩子, \n以为自己再苦兩累,也不能让孩子受委短, 我们还有一种健束有益的选择，进平常心\n平常心源自于对包括残障在内的不同事物的坦然平常态度。从很多方面来说,对待残障的态度和我们对残障的认识有关,也是我们对待各种事物的态度在残障方面的折射,很女\no ouro ত 有可能是放大或极端化。我们对待残障采取的态度,很难和我们对人对事的一般态度截然区分开来。我们在面对一个来到我们家庭中的残障成员的时候,仔细思考我们是审视自己,和孩子一起成长,用平常心来生活,还是自己的原有负面的心态在家庭和残障孩子的生活中延续、放大甚至恶性膨胀。调整我们对残障的态度,也有助于我们调整综合的对待生活的态度。挑战,可以成为机遇。 \n还有,正如前面所述,家长如何看待残障决定着对待孩子的方式,并将影响孩子整个生涯发展的过程。在陪伴孩子成长,实现孩子权利的过程中,身为父母,除了承担日常的教养责任外,还应该主动的了解和思考残障本身,及其所面临挑战的根源。只有充分了解和认识到残障并非悲剧,创造和改变环境比“修复”更能决定未来的发展,才能从挫折感中走出来。 \n更为重要的是,无论孩子是否残障,家庭特别是家长对于一个孩子最终个性的形成都起着决定性的作用,在这个过程中,家长的平常心带动的是孩子对自己的平常心。有无数的案例已经表明,如果家长能够正确认识自己孩子的残障,能够以平常心来面对和思考生活中的挑战,意味着将有机会找到最佳的方法和途径解决这些难题,并传递给孩子一个更为积极的态度和对待生活的主动性。 \n平常的心态会带来对孩子、家长和家庭的理性的选择和行动。如果我们希望社会不要对我们的残障孩子持负面的态度,如果我们希望社会能够给我们的孩子常态和融合的环境,我们就必须从自己对残障的平常心做起。 \nه ه \nב给家长的支持手册\n22 \n০ ا 第二部分oun \n右家庭支持的AN ส N 法律保障、实践意义ه ou \nה \nurn m 给家长的支持手册\nם \nอ 家庭作为一个不可分割的、个体最基本的生活系统在残障人生活中无疑是非常重要的。因此, 《公约》就家庭做了非常具体的相关规定,越来越多的国家开始把制定和完善有关家庭支持的的法律和系统建设作为确保残障权利的一项重要措施。根据家庭在残障孩子的生涯发展中不同阶段的作用,家庭支持相关政策起初主要使18岁以下的残障孩子的家庭受益,后来逐步发展到根据不同的残障和发展特点适当延长年龄,包括成年的、和家庭生活在一起的残障人家庭的支持。针对家庭的法律保障大致分直接和间接两种。直接的政策清楚地针对家庭的需求,而间接的政策则是指任何公共政策中与家庭相关的规定内容。了解政策和家庭支持的相关概念,有助于家长学习相关的政策,明白自身的权利和义务,滋养和改善家庭环境和关系,有的放矢地进行政策倡导。本部分内容以《公约》为基准,简要探讨家庭支持的理论和实践依据和有关家庭参与和支持的基本问题,期望以此展开对适合我国的家庭支持的智慧和经验的汇集、讨论和进一步探索。 第一节家庭支持的理论和现实依据家庭支持的理论是随着家庭参与在孩子教育和发展中的重要性不断凸显和对这种重要性的认识不断提高和重视的过程中发展起来的。相关政策和实践改革的一个重要策略就是在调查研究和经验教训总结的基础上促成系统的、有机的家庭参与。 一、家庭支持的定义家庭支持,根据其目的来定义,是指通过各种必要的保障和措施,确保家庭作为一个系统的统一性、和谐性和安全感,帮助家庭成员之间建立良好关系,在有关家庭和孩子的权利和义务的各方面,帮助家庭提高其行使关键角色作用的能力和意识。 \n这个定义至少包括几个核心的概念: 1·家庭的统一、和谐和安全,即家庭的稳固,这是家庭能够发挥其他作用的前提和基础; \n\n2.家庭的自主性,即家庭有机会和能力做出相关重要选择; \n3,能力提升和参与相关决策,即决定和家庭相关的服务的使用,包括决定是否使用服务和选择使用哪项服务; \n4,以家庭为中心,而不是只关注家长或残障孩子。因为一个家庭成员的残障影响家庭#每位d ,F整个家庭成-系统支持\n\noun ond 24 二、家庭支持的途径对家庭的支持从政府和国家的层面来说通常可以通过三种主要途径来实现: 1.通过法律的制定和实施确保家长在孩子不同发展阶段的有效切实参与; \n2.构建和不断完善家庭支持体系; 3.通过扶持和支持家长机构的专业化发展,来加强家庭支持的体系建设,保障孩子和家长权利的落实。 \n以上三点都是基于一个重要原则:就是对家庭作为一个系统的重视和家长独特和无可替代的作用的深刻认识。 \n毫无疑问,家庭,尤其是家长的参与需要政策的支持,而相关政策的制定和完善需要一个清楚的、一致的和综合的家长参与的概念和构架。从一个宽泛的家长参与的概念出发,家长参与应当从孩子出生到步入成年期贯穿始终。家长参与有三个核心原则: \n1.家长参与是家长、学校和其他相关社区和机构组织之间共同的责任。大家共同致力于保证家长有意义地、切实地参与和家长尽职尽责地、持续地支持孩子的学习和成长发展; 2.家长参与贯穿孩子的生活,其中包含家长持续稳定的职守和伴随孩子成长不同阶段的灵活的角色变化; \n3.家长参与在于随时随地促进孩子的学习成长。有效的家长参与交叉地体现在不同的场所,包括家里、幼儿园和学前、学校、校外项目和社区。 \n这样一个宽泛的家长参与的框架和原则为的是强化多方面责任分担的意识和效果,提升各方能力,以便为家庭提供尽可能多的机会为孩子成功的教育和生涯发展培养好的素养。 \n许多国家在不断完善对残障权利的保护过程中对家长的重要地位和作用的认识基本经历过这样的路程: 1,以预防为主,科学地尊重家庭对个人发展的作用,不断通过修订法律和政策来完善对家庭系统和家长的支持,保护家长作为核心伙伴在有关孩子重大事物决策中的参与权,帮助家长及时有效地把握和满足孩子的需求和家庭作为一个系统的需求,提升家庭的能力通过寻求有效的支持满足这些需求,和通过支持家长机构的专业和能力发展扩大家庭支持; 2.以纠错为主,从忽略给家长的支持中领受到教训,逐步明白如果社会系统忽略了为家长提供支持,就会导致家长无法很好地承担教育和帮助孩子的责任和行使家长独有的重要职能。在汲取经验教训之后,通过修改法律等一系列有效措施矫正过往的错误,逐步保障家长在帮助孩子的过程中能够得到系统的专业支持、适当的选择和依靠,避免家庭盲目、无依靠、走弯路和做错误的选择,耽搁甚至损害孩子的发展。 \n给家长的支持手册ه \n好\n以上的两种情况通常相互渗透,要注重以预防为主,尽早支持家庭,同时要能够及时发现问题,积累和总结经验,不断探索有效的路径。作为家长,为了更好地参与,要特别注意一下几点: \n1.要有意识地提升自己了解、表达和满足家庭和残障孩子需求的能力,要明白我们不一定或不完全准确地了解家庭和孩子的需求,但了解需求的能力可以不断通过学习提升,最重要的是要有了解需求的意识。还有,要向老师等有关方面表达需求,为家庭和孩子能够得到适当的支持采取主动的态度,表达要准确,促成有效交流和沟通渠道; \n2.家长需要了解所处的环境,环境中具备的和不具备的家庭支持的条件,才能明白什么是可以利用的,什么是去要去争取和改变的。要通过积极的参与和各方配合,有理有据的倡导改变。 \n3.要有良好的心态和眼界,相信我们所做的努力对家庭和每个成员的生活质量都有益,明白我们此时所采取的态度可能是我们通常持有的对待事物的态度在残障相关问题上的折射,换一种积极的视角,就意味着只是因为残障,我们多了一个既是挑战也可以是正面对待生活的切入点,这样,我们孩子才能成为适当、科学支持的收益者。 三、家长的政策倡导作用家长在相关政策倡导方面的作用可以从他们的不同角色作用和系统的制约因素相关。首先,家长在相关政策倡导方面的角色作用可以从以下五个基本方面来开始了解: 1.家长和家庭是以家庭支持为中心的家长机构的成员,受益者和贡献者,能够在机构的带领下形成合力的、有理有据的和一致的倡导; \n2.家长和家庭最关注为残障孩子开发有关教育、休闲娱乐、居家和职业相关的服务,并且是有效的服务,通常对孩子的特点和需求最了解,或者应当最了解; \n3.家长和家庭在寻求专业支持的过程中和有关的专家有持续和紧密的联系和互动。在这个过程中,家长是选择做被动的接受者,还是主动的合作者,对相关专业的发展和对政策的引导至关重要,尤其是在以专家为主导的法律政策制定机制中; \n4·家长和家庭作为学校的重要伙伴,自始至终配合执行学校所计划的教育和支持计划,在计划的制定及相关的学校政策的制定中的决策作用和主动参与应受到法律的保护; 5.家长和家庭保护残障家庭成员免受歧视,是相关政策制定和执行的过程中最坚实的力量; \n即便对家长和家庭的作用的认识不断地提高,在一定的环境和相当长的时期内,家长的作用的行使受到很多系统因素的制约,大致存在于以下三个方面: \n1.家长被当作教育、康复和转衔等服务的设计和提供的旁观者，而不是积极主动的参与者。在这样的被动关系中,家长很有可能不能及时全面地提供有关孩子的信息,使得家庭和学校、机构和政府之间的合作受到阻碍,进而影响这些服务的提供和成效; \n2.家长的作用在残障孩子的发展中最关键地体现在婴幼儿早期教育和发展、预防情绪和行为问题和获得健康等方面的支持。然而,这种关键作用长期以来没有得到社会和家庭的重视,家长通常在孩子的婴幼儿时期获得非常有限的法律、政策专业和机构的支持,处于孤立无援的境地。这个问题迫切需要引起重视; \n3.民间的家长机构的发展需要尽快得到社会的广泛支持,需要有一种民间和社会对接和对话的机制,让民间家长机构的先进做法尽快复制,产生广泛和深入的社会效果,这将是对残障个人、家庭和社会事半功倍的好事,在资源紧缺的情况下,让有限的资源发挥积极的作用。 在残障权利的推进过程中,围绕家长和家庭的作用,发生着三种变化:第一是家长的角色作用越来越从被动转向主动;第二是有关支持的定义的变化,从把残障的程度和个体的能力当作重心来支持逐步转变为关注对环境的支持和由此给人的全面发展带来的影响;第三,支持的对象也在发生变化,由侧重对残障家长成员的支持转变为把家庭作为一个有机的系统的支持。这些转变为更加准确地定义和发展家庭支持系统,最大限度地保护残障者及其家庭的利益带来了新的要求。 \nounFou r \n给家长的支持手册ه \nタ \n27 \nত 第二节《公约》与家庭的权利和家庭支持2006年12月13日由第61届联合国大会正式通过, 2008年5月3日正式生效的《残疾人权利公约X 《公约》 )是联合国历史上通过的第一个内容全面的保护残障人权利的公约。 《公约》改变着我们对残疾的认识,其核心是确保残障者享有的、作为人所固有的、与其他人相同的权利,并以有责任公民的身份生活,有平等的机会,全面参与各项事务,为社会作出应有的贡献。中国政府率先于2007年3月30日和2008年8月1日相继签署和批准了《公约》 ,作为履约国将采取更加积极的行动,不断按照《公约》的原则完善相关法律,切实改善残障人状况,保护和促进其平等权利。 一、 《公约》中的相关内容虽然《公约》的宗旨是确保残障人的权利,由于家庭为有残障的家庭成员提供最初始、最直接、和最长久的依靠,残障人的权利无可避免地和家庭的角色和生活质量紧密联系在一起。因此, 《公约》充分认识到、强调并且切实保护家庭在养育残障孩子中的重要角色作用。在《公约》的“序言”第二十四条中直接明确: \n深信家庭是自然和基本的社会组合半元,有奴获得社会和国家的保护,E疾人及其家庭成员应获得必更的保护和援助,使家庭能够为球疾人充分和平等地享有其却利作出贡献。 \n纵观《公约》五十条,其中有五条直接和明确地提到家庭:即第八、十六、二十二、二十三和二十八条。我们在理解这几条的含义时,最直接地要结合以上提到的序言,还有《公约》第三条“一般原则”的八条具体内容,即: \n本公约的原则是: H尊重固有尊严和个人自主,包括自由作出自己的送择,以及A人的自立\nA不规， 与充分和切实越参与和融社会, \n四尊重差异,受残疾人是人的多样性的一部分和人类的一份子, 国现会的等, \n成无壁碍出男女平等, \n给家长的支持手册ه \n1 \n28 V尊重残疾儿童逐渐发展的能力并尊重残疾儿童保持其身份特性的却利。 第八条关于“提高认识”我们前面已经提到。在此不重复讨论。 \n第十六条是关于“免于剥削、暴力和凌虐” 。虽然这一条禁止对残障人任何形式的残酷和非人行为,但特别强调杜绝此类行为在家庭中的发生,并且为此要给予家庭相应的监督和支持。第十六条的具体内容如下: \n一,第约国应当采顾一切适当的立法,行政,社会,教育和其他措施,保护球疾人在病庭内外免遭一切形式的刷脚,暴力和美建,包括基天性别的刷削,暴力和凌虐。 \n二,纺约画还应当采取一切适当着越防止一切形式的刷别,暴力和凌虐,屏其他外,磅保向残疾人及其京属和照护人提供考虑到性别和年我的适当协助和支助,包括提供信息和教育,说明如何避免,识别和报告剥脚,暴力和建事件。射幼国应当研保保护服务考房到年衡,性别和残疾因素。 \n三.为了防止发生任何形式的剥脚,暴力和签虐,统约国应当磅保所有用于为E疾人服务的设施和方案受到轴立当局的有效监测。 \n四,居疾A受到任何形式的刷.暴力或安e时,射约国应当采取一切适当措施,自居提供保护服务,促送越害A的身体, i知功能和心理的浓度,质复及回归社会。上述e复着施和回归社会着應应当在有利F本A的健康,超t,自尊,尊严和自主的环境中进行,并应当考虑到因性别和年斜而异的具体需要。 \n五.维约国应当制定有效的立活和政策，包括以妇女和儿童为重点的立活和政策,磅保查明,调查和励情起诉励医疾A的剥別,暴力和凌虐事件。 \n第二十二条是关于“尊重隐私” 。家庭对残障人的隐私权的尊重和保护与家人对残障人的独立性、能力等方面的认识密切相关。因为对残障的负面态度和错误观念,残障人的隐私权受到很大的有意或无意的侵犯,足以引起我们在家庭范围内对这个问题的警醒和认识。第二十二条的具体内容如下: \n一.居疾A,不论其居所她或居生安排为何,其隐私,疾庭,家居和通信以及其他形式的交流,不得受到任意或非法的干质,其荣誉和名誉也不得受到非法t击。残疾人有欢获得法律的保护,不受这种干烦或攻击。 \n二,结约国应当在与其他A平等的基础上保护残疾A的个X.解康和康复货料的磨私。 第二十三条是关于“尊重家居和家庭” 。这一条完全和家庭相关,涉及残障人成家、做父母的权利(1-2部分)和残障孩子在家庭中的权利、福祉和享受的照顾(3-5部分)告诉我们残障人有权利和家庭一起生活,不能因残障而和家庭隔离。政府应当为家庭提供有关残障的支助、信息和服务。 \n女ه \n一,第约国应当采取有农和适当的措施,在涉及婚姻哀庭,生育和个人关系的一切事项中,在与其他人严等的基础上,消除对残疾人的歧规,公确保\n/所有适婚年牌的E疾人都据未婚E解R方自由表示的充分同意结婚和建立家庭的却利奈得研i,

\n四.第约国应当磅保不透背儿童父安的意原使子女与父母分需,屏非主章兰局休照适用的法律和程序,经司法复体断定这种分需磅有必要,符合儿童本人的展佳利益。在任何情况下均不得以子女群疾或父母一方或取方席疾为理由,使子女与父母分需。 \n五,第约国应当在近亲属不能照顾残疾儿童的情况下,每一切努力在大家庭范围内提供替代性照顾,并在无法提供这种照顾时,在社区内提供家庭式照顾。 第二十八条是关于“适足的生活水平和社会保护” ,重心是满足残障人及其家庭对居家生活和社会保障的需求,要求政府保障家庭提供适当的居家生活(第一部分)和帮助处于贫困中的残障人(第二部分) 。尽管不同的国家对这一条有不同的诠释,但并不妨碍这一条成为国家相关社会保障法律和政策的核心。需要特别注意的是,在《公约》起草的过程中,尽管大多数代表团对国家支持和保护残障人的过程中维护家庭的角色作用给予越来越多的肯定,同时也要求保护残障人的独立自主,防止出现家庭对残障人的侵害。 \n一.纺约国磅以球疾人有权为自己及其家属获得适足的生活水平，包括适足的食物衣物,住房,以及不断政摩坐活条件,射约国应当采取适当步骤,保障和促送在不受基于球疾的歧起的情况不实现这项却利。

《公约》通过前所未有的强烈表述,要求社会对残障者平等参与所遇到的障碍负责,要求改变残障人所生活的环境对残障长久以来所持有的不正确看法。这一点,我们在第一部分着重地阐述过。在这里需要强调的是,这种改变并不会因为《公约》被签署和批准就自然而然地发生。它需要社会各界,包括家长及其代表机构对这种改变发生的重要性和必要性的充分认识和合力行动,并且要坚持不懈,不轻易放弃。观念的改变是同时和自己以及外界较量的过程。 \n2. 《公约》在起草和通过的过程中有着残障人及其代表机构的持续参与和主导作用,这在其他国际公约的起草过程中是前所未有的。 “没有我们的参与,请不要做相关于我们的决定”不仅精确地描述了这一主导作用,而且成为《公约》在本土落实上的指导原则。家庭也应当对此予以重视。 \n3.尽管《公约》旨在赋予残障人已有的人权保护,但也增加更多新的、具体的权利,比如“合理便利” 、 “融合教育” 、 “社区生活” 、 “无障碍” 、 “支持” 、 “信息无障碍” “提高认识”等。 \n4. 《公约》的所有条款相互依存,把残障人的民事权利和政治权利的共同实现相互紧密联系起来,比如平等和不歧视的权利和各种重要场所的合理便利的保障的密切联系等。 三、家长在促进《公》落фЕ 落实《公约》无疑对社会、家庭和个人都具有深远的意义,然而如何落实《公约》是一个难以量的挑战。对于家长来说,面对这样的挑战,除了深入学习《公约》 ,还要积极宣传和努力倡导。 \n那么,在残障人权利时代,身为残障儿童的父母,如何理解《公约》的精神?如何能安\nا ه \n站在权利的视角,人类尊严的高度去思考子女所面对的困境?进而解决现实遇到的困难,找到前进的新方向呢? \n首先,家长拥有公民的各种权利和义务,和所有孩子的父母拥有同等的权利和义务,仅仅是体现会有所不同。 \n其次,家长要充分了解残障孩子的权利,清楚认识到自己是能够改变社会正确对待残障孩子的最重要的倡导者。 \n第三,家长还需要反省自身,作为监护人和孩子权利的最重要保护者,是不是在不知情中也有侵犯和剥夺孩子权利的时候?家长唯有把作为父母的爱升华到对生命固有权利的尊重和保护,才能真正帮助孩子的各项权利得到保障,使他们健康成长。 \n残障儿童的父母,要充分认识自己在保障孩子各项发展中的关键作用,行使自己的权利,承担抚养孩子、教育和支持孩子的责任,寻求社会资源的协助,帮助孩子实现他们生存发展的各种权利。 \nه ב给家长的支持手册\n32 \n০ \nه 第三节M知识到行动书面的知识需要转化为行动。对于家庭来说,伴随残障孩子成长的不同阶段,家庭会遇到教育,康复、社交生活和生涯发展等方面的突出问题。每个残障人的家庭作为一个系统的需求纷繁复杂,和许多因素相关,有家庭作为一个系统的内部因素和家庭外部因素。家庭内部因素大致可以涉及四个部分,即家庭的特点,包括家庭作为一个整体的特点、每个成员的不同特点和孩子的残障带来的特点;家庭内部的各种关系和互动;家庭满足每个成员的需求的功能和残障对家庭功能的影响以及家庭的动态生活变化。家庭的外部因素有所处的周边环境,能够获取的资源和支持等。鉴于此,展示有限的、没有具体针对性的支持方法,远远不能普遍满足家庭的个性需求。在这里,我们把每个家庭所关注的突出主题,针对家长,以问题的形式给大家展示出来。有些问题相互交叉,主要是为了在一些重要的问题上让读者,尤其是单个家庭、结伴的家庭、家长机构从多角度去思考和理解问题的来龙去脉和可能的解决办法。家长机构也可以使用这些问题调查家庭的需求,有的放矢地设计相应的支持的培训、讨论和宣传等项目。对这些问题及时和有意识地思考和交流,能够把每个家庭的经验、智慧和创意汇集起来,让改变随时发生,在每个家长身上发生,在每个家庭里发生,在每对家庭伙伴之间发生,在每个家长机构中发生。让改变成为自觉的行动,有意识的行动,有共识和公信力的行动,源源不断地汲取智慧和力量的行动,真正对家庭和孩子有现实和长远意义的行动,能够建设性地促成良好社会环境的行动。 一、康复世界卫生组织定义残障人的康复为“一个过程,旨在使残障人能够达到或保持他们最佳的肢体、感官、智力、心理和社会功能水平。康复为残障人提供他们获得独立和自我决断所需的工具和手段。 \n2010年,世界卫生组织以提倡“朝向包容性社区”为核心,出版了《社区康复指南》提出该指南的总体目标为: \n★提供如何发起与加强社区康复的指导,开展与《残疾人权利公约》和其他相关文件原则相一致的社区康复项目。 \n\n*促进社区康复作为社区包融性发展策略,以帮助残障人融合发展,尤其是减轻贫困。 ★支持有关方面满足残障人的基本需求,使能获得健康、教育、谋生及社会层面的机会,以提高残障人及其家庭的生活质量。 \n\n鼓励项目人通过促进残障人融入与参与发展及决策过程,促进残障人及其家庭提高社会地位。 \n给家长的支持手册อ \n这本指南所提出的社区康复结构图,有五个关键部分组成:健康、教育、谋生、社会和赋能。每个部分又包含五个基本要素。 *健康包括健康促进、疾病预防、医疗保健、康复和辅助器具; \n\n教育包括幼年教育、基础教育、中高等教育、非正规教育和终身学习;谋生包括技能发展、自我营生、有薪就业、金融服务和社会保护; \n\n★社会包括他人帮助、人际关系和婚姻家庭、文化和艺术、娱乐休闲和体育活动和司法。 *赋能包括倡导和沟通、社区动员、政治参与、自助小组和残障人组织。 \n按照世界卫生组织的指南所给出的这个有关康复的重要构架,我们来共同思考一下在现实的环境中有关康复家长常常纠结的问题,来进行拆解、对照和反思。 \n34 1.有关早期康复的目的常听到的声音,E障孩子的主要希望是尔早通过使复交正常。 \n请通过以下问题反思我们对康复的目的的认识是否正确、全面: \n家长普遍认为康复的目的是什么?家长这么认为的理由是什么? \n是否能把康复当成治病? \n当我们听到某些康复机构说能治好残障,我们该怎么做? \n从世界卫生组织的定义来看,康复的主要目的应该是什么？ \n2.有关早期康复的计划、设计、实施和评估\n常听到的声音,我们家长不懂专业,听康复机构的就可W了/ \n请通过以下问题思考家长在其中的作用:

\n家长对康复机构的服务应当如何鉴别和对待?是否应该被动地照单全收? \n4,关于早期康复的科学性、适当性和针对性常听到的声音,不治好孩子就没希望请从以下问题所指方面思考早期康复: 康复是孩子的主要甚至绝对生活内容吗?在孩子的日常生活中占多大程度?这种绝对性对孩子有益吗? \n\n残障孩子的其他发展需求是什么?这些需求有没有得到关注?有没有想过如果不关注对孩子的影响是什么?该如何避免或减轻这些影响? \n有没有和其他家长分享相关经验教训?有哪些教训应当汲取,哪些良好经验值得效法?机构如何有组织地通过各种有效方式让家长相互交流? \n家长知道孩子的特长吗?康复对孩子的特长有什么帮助?是否及时和准确地与康复老师就此沟通? \n5.残障孩子的早期康复和常态的生活常听到的声音,孩子不能和其他孩子一样生活都是因为残壁/ \n\n请按照以下问题思考如何为孩子营造常态生活: \n\n孩子有时间和机会和其他伙伴交流和玩耍吗?家长是如何寻找和创造这样的机会的?有哪些好的效果? \n孩子有时间和机会学习各种适当的生活技能吗?如何开发他们在自然和常态的环境中学习技能的机会？ \n家长和孩子有足够的情感等方面交流吗？ \n6,有关康复的资源常听到的声音,没有康复机构孩子就没有康复机会/ \n请按照下面问题思考寻求康复资源的策略: 给家长的支持手册\n5 家庭周边有哪些资源和服务可以利用? \n有哪些成功寻找资源的个案?为什么他们能成功?我们的情况和他们有什么相似和不同? \n有哪些自然资源可以利用和开发? \n是否及如何和其他家长分享和分析有关康复的资源信息？ \n7.康复的成功经验和教训常听到的声音,其他的家长都主要投A到孩子的康复中,我也得这样\n请按照以下问题思考如何从别人的经验中学到智慧: 家庭周边有哪些不成功的家庭故事?为什么他们不成功? \n有哪些教训可以汲取?我们能为别的家庭提供什么帮助? \n为什么分享经验和教训很重要? \n如何在个人和环境的改变相互收益,为孩子争取更好环境？ \n8.有关康复所需的支持系统常听到的声音:康复是家庭和康复机构之间的事情/ \n请按照以下问题思考家长如何促成康复体系的建立和完善: 家长是否明白康复需要学校、机构和家庭的共同合作? \n家长在这个支持体系中起什么作用？ \n家庭需要什么样的信息沟通渠道? \n9.有关康复的倡导常听到的声音,我没有时间和精力参与机构的事情\n请按照下面问题思考家长是否重视合力倡导的作用: 家长在早期康复倡导的过程中如何和家长机构、残障自组织、专业团队和个人及政府合作? \n家长机构如何帮助家长提升有关康复的决策和参与能力? 36 《公约》第二十四条“教育”对残障接受包容性教育的权利做了明确的规定。近几年来,在探索如何更好地推进融合教育的方面,取得很好的成效。以下是融合教育的实践所面临的和家长密切相关的问题,为的是和家长一同澄清是非,探索解决问题的方向和途径。 二、融合教育\n1.有关对融合教育的态度常听到的声音,我的孩子待殊,有问题,所以有融台的困难。 \n请根据以下问题思考隔离的根源: 家长是否知道学前教育的孩子不懂隔离? \n隔离是如何产生的? \n普通孩子的家长是如何看待融合教育的? \n改变融合教育的态度从何时开始?从何入手? \n就近的学校不支持融合教育怎么办? \n融合教育是为了让残障孩子能挤进普通学校吗? \n有人说融合教育对其他孩子不公平甚至有害,这些观点的理由是什么?这些理由成立吗\n2.有关融合教育的三要素:平等入学机会、有效参与和适当支持常听到的声音,残壁学生在普校不能进步,因此融合教育不应该提倡。 \n请从以下问题入手,思考制约融合教育实践的障碍和消除障碍的策略: 当学校拒绝接受我们的残障孩子入学我们该怎么办?如何有效和学校沟通? \n在可能的情况下,家长是否应当向学校隐瞒孩子的残障?这样做对我们孩子的短期ه \n和长期后果是什么? \n在替残障孩子择校做决定时,家长应当采取哪些步骤?如何做决定? \n孩子在班级和学校很孤立,家长该怎么办? \n当残障孩子在普通学校情况不乐观我们该怎么办? \n家长如何为孩子争取适当融合教育支持? \nค \nا \n37 好\nอ 3.有关融合教育的益处常听到的声音:融合教育是为特殊学生的,对普通学生不一定有益处。 \n请从以下方面不断思考和表达融合教育对所有学生的益处: \n我们了解融合教育的益处吗?我们会表达和倡导融合教育的益处吗? \n当普通学校的教育达不到融合教育的效果家长怎么办? \n残障孩子的家长如何和普通孩子的家长沟通融合教育的对每个孩子的好处? \n家长如何和普通学校的老师沟通孩子的残障问题? \n4.关于家长的角色作用\n常听到的声音,老师和学校是主导,家长不专业,应当听从学校\n请深刻认识和宣传家长不可替代的角色作用: \n家长和老师、学校应当保持什么关系?现实是什么关系?两者有什么差距? \n在你的环境中近期和较长时期改善家长参与的困境的途径有哪些?家长可以如何去做? \n在推进学校、地区和国家重视家长的相关政策时,家长可以和应当做什么? \n5.有关融合教育的倡导\n常听到的声音,家长倡导没有用! \n请按照以下问题思考如何争取多方的支持有理有据的倡导: \n家长对融合教育的政策了解吗? \n家长如何能把对学校的倡导变成和学校一起为融合教育倡导? \n家长在为孩子的融合教育机会倡导时,表现出对孩子的尊重吗? \n融合的实践,需要不断地丰富。家长应当在困难中采取什么态度?

三、融入社区生活成年阶段的残障者有着和其他人一样的各种丰富而个性的需求,也有伴随残障的特别需求。按照常态的生活目标,孩子步入成年应当自主和独立的生活,比如学会处理人际关系、融入社区、步入社会及成家立业,并作出相关的决策,有的时候可能需要一定的支持。但是,在社会支持系统远远未能满足残障者的需求时,家长往往在这个阶段仍然进行替代性决策或者进入无力和无奈的放弃阶段。因此,我们有关社区融入的问题,尽可能涉及到家庭和残障人共同纠结和关心的问题,引起大家共同的思考: 1.在融入社区的问题上,家长通常思考和选择的角度和出发点是什么? 2.残障孩子,尤其是心智障碍的孩子融入社区有很多自己的特点和需要。家长注意发现和尊重这些特点了吗?关于这一点,请进一步细化问题: \n家长应当如何看待有不同特点的孩子？ \n周围有哪些家庭做的比较好?这些好的做法给孩子和家庭带来什么益处? \n家庭有哪些不好的做法?为什么不好?如何尽快避免和改善? \n3.在融入社区的过程中,孩子的特点和发展需求是否是家长关注的核心? \n4.家长在多大程度上应当按照孩子的意愿和需求做选择?为什么? \n当家长对孩子的选择能力不放心的时候,应当怎么办? \n家长是通过支持孩子在实践选择的过程中提高选择的能力还是认为最好替孩子做决\n定?为什么？ \nn o \n家长如何有意识地从小到大培养孩子做选择和决定的能力?如果没有意识,为什么?如果有意识,是如何做的? \n家长是否相互之间学习培养孩子的能力?有什么好的做法值得推广和学习?有什么不好的地方需要反思和注意纠正? \n5,残障孩子融入社区主要遇到哪些障碍？ \n态度障碍体现在哪些方面?造成了什么效果?改变的方法有哪些?家长如何参与到改变中? \n环境障碍有哪些?哪些是尽快可以改善的?家长能参与到哪些改变中?哪些是需要长期努力的?可以有哪些和家长相关的短期和长期策略? \nFou \n有哪些障碍是来自残障孩子本身的局限?如何看待他们融入社区的目标和他们特点的对接？ \n给家长的支持手册ه \n6.您的残障孩子融入社区需要什么支持?周边的社区有哪些支持?没有哪些支持? \n7.您的孩子有没有居家生活和社区独立生活的能力? \n如果有,这些能力表现在哪些方面?这些能力是怎么培养出来的? \n如果没有,原因在哪里? \n8,作为家长,您如何看待残障与性的问题? \n针对残障孩子,您是否谈性变色? \n您是否觉得应当提倡和尊重残障人的性权利?针对不同的残障类别,您是否有不同的看法？为什么？ \n\n作为家长,您关注和引导过孩子在这方面的需求了吗? \n\n如何看待残障孩子青春期的交友需求?应采取什么做法? \n9.作为家长,您对残障孩子的婚姻问题如何对待?您是否干涉残障孩子的婚姻?为什么? \n10. 《公约》中的相关内容您作为家长熟悉吗? \n有没有和家庭及残障孩子一起学习讨论过?如果有,这部分内容最有帮助的方面在哪里？ \n有没有和其他家庭一起学习讨论过?如果有,哪方面内容对大家都有帮助? 四、转衔中的支持:从家庭婴幼儿到融合学童,再到社会从业者从家庭到幼儿园、学校生活,再走向成人生活,残障人和其他人一样要度过至少两个关键的转衔期,即从婴幼儿到义务教育阶段的学生的转衔和从学生到社会从业者的转衔。在每个时期,一方面要转介,另一方面要衔接,所以称为“转衔” 。与其他人不同的是,他们的转衔伴随很多和残障相关特点。转衔期是一个人从一个特定生活阶段进入到一个新的生活阶段的关键期,伴随着有计划、目标和支持的转衔教育,包括学术和功能两方面教育。 \n转衔应当包括以下要素: \n1·转衔服务,即在一个阶段内为一个残障学生设计的一系列协调的活动,旨在提高该生的学术和功能成果,协助其向下个生活阶段的过度; \n\nnFounds \n2.基于学生的需求和考虑其特长、爱好和兴趣的服务设计; 在这些重要的转折期,他们需要得到来自各方,尤其是家长的支持。我们将它称为转衔期的支持。家长成为转衔支持和孩子的生涯发展最关键和持久的支持力量。虽然转衔过程中各方的支持及配合对转衔的成功很重要,但是家庭的参与和支持需要得到特别的关注。 \n转衔是一个过程,不是一个点,需要从转衔期到来之前就开始支持。残障孩子除了两个最关键的转衔期需要支持,他们在求学路上、在家庭生活、社区使用、社交等多种活动也需要支持,以便为成功的转衔做好积淀和预备。而这些重要的支持中不能缺少各个领域专家的专业支持和来自父母、亲戚、邻居、同事和教师提供的自然支持。 \n原因主要有以下几点: 1.家庭应当最了解成年生活的目标。在从学校向社会转衔的过程中,残障孩子对这个目标也应当尽可能了解,这个了解的过程需要得到学校和家庭的帮助; \no \n2.家庭深知自己核心家庭所拥有的资源和较强方面; \n3.家庭也相对了解拓展的家庭的资源和较强方面,以及社区的资源; \n4.家庭曾经使用过的服务和服务提供方和相关人员是可以分享的有用资源。 \n以下,我们根据两个转衔其家庭的独特和重要作用,提出不同方面的问题: \n1.从婴幼儿向学校教育的转街\n家庭是否在早期支持方面预备孩子进入融合学校的素养?您的孩子过于胆怯吗?对家人过于依赖吗?不喜欢和其他孩子玩耍吗?会表达自己的想法吗?等等。这些问题和家庭对孩子的教养方法有什么关系? \n家庭是否存在过度保护、封闭和不适当支持? \n家长是否有意识地对获得对孩子的有效评估,以便做好适合孩子的择校和入学计划? 家庭是否有策略地了解、培养和突破周围的环境,为残障孩子能够接受融合教育做准备?就近学区哪些学校融合的态度和观念相对好一些?如何利用家长群里的信息资源掌握相关情况?如何向其他家长学习好的经验?如何建设性地发挥家长合力的功效?如何突破来自普通孩子的家长和学校的抵触和排斥?等等; \n2.从中级教育或职业教育向就业或高等教育的转变\n家长是否因为恐惧、怕麻烦或不了解而在孩子点点滴滴的成长过程中不断地消磨了残障孩子未来发展的梦想? \n家长是否意识到您的孩子因为残障也许有不同、但可能是很好的发展路径,而您的眼界和开放心态会帮助孩子有最好的发展？ \n安ه \n家长是否能对孩子持高期望值?这样做的重要性和意义在哪里?家长对孩子的期望值是否和孩子的特点和特长直接相关?如何把高期望值融汇到给孩子的支持中?是否从及早开始稳定而循序渐进地进行? \n家长是否因为残障而出现持低期望值的情况?对孩子持低期望值的害处有哪些?家长日常是否反思自己有意无意地对残障孩子持低期望值? \nou \n家长如何就期望值方面的问题和老师保持交流,避免孩子在学校受到低期望值的影响? \n转换的计划和支持什么时候开始? \n家长如何支持孩子做好就业机会的选择和开发? \n家长在有关就业的支持服务中担当什么角色? \n家长如何和就业辅导员合作? \nurn on eou \nه t \n给家长的支持手册\n42 \n০ ه \nا oou \n第三部分\nu ا \n有下\n家长组织\nn urn \n给家长的支持手册\n43 ם \n5 \n家长组织通常也称为家长自助组织或者家长互助组织,属于公益组织(非营利性民间组织)中互益性的类别,通常是指有相似经历的人(家长)自愿建立起来的互相帮助的团体。家长组织的发展在不同的环境中虽然有不同的特点,但都体现了一个由家长的独特和重要角色作用所带来的自发性、必然性、义务性、灵活性和牢固性。 绝大多数残障儿童及其家庭在面对残障所带来的的种种挑战和巨大压力时,生活轨迹偏离主流轨道,适应性困难,逐渐走进困境中。无数家长孤独面对现实,独自承受着精神、生活的各方面压力,各自封闭式的生活着。有的家长放弃工作走上陪伴孩子求医、求训、求学、求助等路程,得不到适合的专业支持,也看不到希望,陷入孤立无助的困境。他们迫切需要全面支持和专业的引导。 伴随着社会的巨大变化,家长在改变,同时家长也在反过来改变着社会。有些家长中的先行者,敏锐地吸收先进理念,增强权利意识,选择积极主动的行动,从个人家庭的改变开始,走近其他家长,汇集家长的力量和身后丰富资源,寻求团队的力量和行动。共同的命运与追求,共同的责任与使命,让越来越多的家长们认识到应该联合起来,相互支撑,互相帮助,共同认识和表达残障子女生涯发展各阶段的权利与需求,做政府制定相应政策的伙伴,寻求和促进各种专业的支持,联合其他的机构力量,和残障子女一同追求有尊严而体面的生活。 在过去的10年中,家长组织在家长的努力和各界的帮助下,随着信息时代的便利,迅速发展起来。家长组织的发展有遍布广,自愿性强、设置简单、高效率、跨残障类别等特点。在实践过程中,特别引人注目的是,很多成功的家长组织重视提高政府和社会各个方面对于家长参与的重要性和家长之间伙伴支持的不可替代性的认识,有针对性和策略性地进行积极倡导。随着社会的不断重视,各地的家长组织正迅速发展。家长组织起来,携手工作,共同构筑融合和接纳的空间,分享各种活动带来的生机、改变、温暖与力量,改变自己的观念、家庭生活状态、孩子的面貌,影响周围人。家长组织的成立的发展带给大家希望与期待。 在这个积极的、有成效的发展过程中,家长组织也普遍面临一些大的挑战。首先,家长组织内部互动相对较强,但存在外围合作突破相对较弱的情况,其中包括来自专业支持的缺乏,和普通孩子家长、普通教育老师、康复等专业人员等的互动没有形成规模等;其次,家长组织如何设计符合家长需求的项目来满足家庭的需求一直有很多的困惑和迷茫;再次,组织的凝聚力需要提高,即如何让家长明白机构的强壮能使每个家庭受益,需要每个参与家庭的支持,家长和组织是相互支持,共同成长的关系,以及通过什么策略吸引家长对组织的支持等;还有,各家长组织对自身的专业发展定位问题,也影响到不同家长机构相辅相成的、平衡的专业发展和倡导的有效性;最后,家长组织内部的领导力的发展,以及如何培养有能力和意愿带领社区家长的家长领导者,以便是家长倡导能够深入社区,也是一个亟待得到重视的问题。 \n基于对以上情况的综合考量,以下的内容着重于介绍家长组织的作用、所处的各种关系和家庭支持的途径和特点等。家长组织在不同文化背景下的发展有其丰富的差异性,下面这些高度概括的介绍出发点在于激发对家长机构的良好发展的想法和实践。 \nਵ ه 探讨家长组织的作用,首先需要从明白和重视家长的作用入手,而一个好的家长组织,能够重视家庭的需求和优势,不断地拓展其专业发展,让家长的个体作用得到最有效的发挥,并且把每个家长的力量和资源汇集起来为家长服务。就家长最关心的孩子的发展问题来说,促进孩子发展的最有效途径之一就是保证家长在孩子教育和相关重要方面的参与和给家长参与赋能。这对每个孩子来说都是如此。对残障孩子来说,因为他们在生涯发展的各个阶段遇到的多重的、严峻的挑战,则需要家长更大程度的参与和倡导,以保证残障孩子能够和其他的孩子一样得到有利机会和发展成果。家长的作用在于不仅能为孩子做倡导,而且能够作为包括老师在内的专业人员的重要伙伴,根据家长对孩子需求的深度了解提供宝贵的意见、建议和监督。 第一节家长组织的作用和专业发展家长组织的作用可以具体从两个方面来认识:家长组织的种类和特点。 一、家长组织的种类家长组织有不同类型,发挥不同功能和作用: 1.倡导型:搭建政府相关部门或相关企业和组织与残障人士及其家长的桥梁,发挥纽带作用,推动特定议题的进步。 \n2.服务型:满足残障人士及其家长的需求,提供相应服务,总结经验,推广应用,发挥示范引领作用,让更多人受益。 \n3·孵化型:家长组织实施的成功活动或项目,总结固化成册,传播到各地,供更多的家长组织效仿、发展。为其他家长组织的建立和发展提供各种协助。 \n4·赋能型:家长组织编写和发放培训教材,与其他机构合作,通过各种有效渠道宣传或开办培训班,发挥核心主体作用,帮助其他家长机构和个人拓展网络系统,通过提升家长和机构的能力,综合推动家长组织及其作用的进一步发挥。 \n家长组织通常并非截然地把自己定位于一种。大多数家长机构按照家长的需求和机构的特长兼顾不同的职能,或有所侧重,或同向发展。家长组织的工作可以是全方位的,涉及以下不同方面的支持项目: \n1.社区建立早期干预中心(0-3岁); 2.学前教育与康复:融合幼儿园(4-6岁)等; \nا 5 \n3.基础教育:特殊教育学校或普通小学(7-16岁九年义务教育); \n4,中学后教育(含中等职业教育、高等教育和研究生教育); \n5.职业培训站或就业指导站(17-25岁); \n6.社区之家或居家生活、独立工作(26-50岁); \n7.托养服务、养老服务(51岁以上)及转衔服务中心等二、家长组织的特点国际和国内的丰富经验和实践表明,家长组织能够将“遭遇类似问题的家长自行组织或在专业人员的协助下组织起来,共同商讨解决问题的办法和分享各自面对困难时的经验和知识” 。家长组织虽然种类不同,都有以下共同特点: \n1.能够帮助成员消除或减轻在实际生活中受到的“伤害\" ,或者从这些伤害中逐步恢复过来,消除或缓解成员心理压力,调整和改善各种关系; \n2.能够汇集、分类和传递家庭所需的各种信息,而且信息渠道广泛,传播速度快; \n\n3.能够通过集中的意见表达来从小到大、从身边到社会影响各种相关政策和实践。 \n\n4,能够提升包括残障孩子在内的家庭的生活信心及品质,大大节约社会服务的成本; \n以上前面两点体现家长之间的情绪和信息的支持的独特性和无可替代性在家长组织的形式下的有效性,即组织可以通过培训等各种策略培育“老兵”家长给新家长提供传帮带的支持,使家长之间的伙伴支持系统化和专业化;后两点则体现家长组织的有力的倡导和给家庭和社会共同带来的益处。接下来就这两个方面进行进一步阐述。 \n首先,因为家长之间的伙伴支持是家长组织的一个重要特色,这里简介建立这种伙伴支持可以采取的基本步骤。家长和代表组织可以以此为基础,循序渐进,不断深化拓展: \n1.要意识到每个家庭都可以为其他家庭提供支持,好的经验和不好的教训都能帮助别人,关键是交流互动,在互动的过程中不断加深对家庭需求的了解,一同不断学习和积累经验方法,相互鼓励和减压。因此要主动地接触其他家庭,找到合适的伙伴家庭,彼此从对方的角度出发,做好的听众和陪伴者,时刻保持开放心态,培养信任感和凝聚力; \n2.要寻找和提供机会使家长互动起来。家庭要不断地挖掘周围的资源和项目,比如家长培训项目、家长小组或机构、家长网络互动小组或家长对一支持项目等; \n\no \n3·家长、孩子的残障和家庭之间的相似情况越多,伙伴之间也越能够感同身受,相互还有,家长组织是改善残障权利状况的不可或缺的倡导力量,对政府、社会、家长、家庭、残障人士、教师和各种专业人员和公益人都有积极的影响,具体体现在: 支持的成功率的可能性也越大。 1,成为家长力量的源泉,提供平台和机会帮助建立家长伙伴支持关系,使家长获取个人成长和家庭的改善所需的先进理念、情感支持、信息交流和方法沟通,相互鼓励去影响更多人和社会大环境的改变; \n2.通过整合和获取资源、能力建设和各种关系平台的建立,帮助家长建立与各方的伙伴关系和成为支持主力伙伴,在社会支持、家庭支持、专业支持的支持网络中发挥核心作用; 3,有效的家长机构善于广泛联系社会各领域的有心人,推动公益事业,影响更多有公益心的人。 \nouon e \nส \nourn Fo 给家长的支持手册\n3 \n47 \nه อ 第二节家长组织的天系和多方合作家长组织的发展中存在各种重要的关系。无论家长机构的职能、特点如何,都要处理组织和家长之间、组织内部家长和家长之间、组织和政府之间及家长组织和其他相关组织之间的关系。 一、家长个人与家长组织的关系如前面所强调的,家长组织和家长相互依存、互相支持,推动残障权利的发展。一个好的、可持续发展的组织可以通过组织的制衡和调整、专业的引领、领导力的建设和资源的整合把个人单薄的力量汇集成团队有公信力的力量让家庭受益,同时组织离不开每位家长的支持,在家长组织的活动中发挥自身优势和资源,支持家长组织工作不断开展。 \n家长与家长组织相互支持要以尊重、平等、赋能、发展和合作作为支持的准则,以权利、生活品质、支持、融合四个正向思维作为支持的引领。权利是立身之本,生活品质是追求目标,支持是赋能的过程,融合是实现消除障碍、建成友善和谐环境的基础。只有共同努力建设一支有素养、有能力、有行动力的家长团队,家长的改变愿望就能得到最大程度的实现。 从家长组织的角度来说,家长组织是由一个个的家长组成的,没有家长的需求和诉求作为基础,是不可能真正形成家长组织。因此,组织要特别了解和重视家庭的需求,通过组织的推动和项目的支持使家庭的需求得到社会更广泛的重视,为家庭做倡导,帮助家庭满足他们的需求。组织要有能力和意识集合各位家长的智慧和才干,鼓励家长挖掘和贡献自身和社会的资源和条件,积极参与组织的活动。组织要营造氛围和机会服务于残障人士及家长,让每位家长体会自身社会价值,找到继续学习、成长的方向和人生目标。 从家长的角度来说,家长要意识到,一个家长组织能够很好的持续发展,离不开每一个家长的参与和投入。或者说,组织中的家长参与的程度与质量直接关系到家长组织是否能够很好发展。组织领导力、专业能力和服务效果的提升依赖于家长的智慧、才干、眼界和资源。参与家长组织的家长也要明确自己的角色,在一个组织中,家长的角色不再是单纯的孩子“代言人” ,也不能只是一味的“等靠要” ,或者对组织的事务或其他家庭漠不关心。明确和重视自己在组织中的权利和义务,才能让单个家长所关注的事情朝着正确的方向发展,最终让自己和孩子受益。家长组织不是哪一个部门或个人的下属单位,如果自身不发展,就没有外界力量强迫它发展。所以,让每个成员能够积极投入的家长组织是推进相关事务的重要基础。 \nFon \n因此,家长组织与家长个人是在实践过程中共同成长、相互支持的关系。 二、家长组织中家长之间的关系关于家长之间的伙伴支持关系,前面在关于家长组织的特点部分涉及到,重复内容不再赘述。在这里将如何看待和认识家长之间的差异。家长携手走进家长组织,彼此之间交流机会多,研讨问题多,观点不一致,意见不一致是必然的,这恰恰是相互交流的真正价值所在。有差异和不同见解,就能通过互动相互补充、学习、加深对问题的认识和增加解决问题的能力和方法。问题的关键在于珍惜彼此的差异,让合力壮大而不是萎缩。具体可以汲取以下基本经验\n1.要意识到,由于各自的生活、学习、工作背景不同,处理问题的方式也不同。遇事应把人与行为分开,待人应把优点与不足分开,把意愿或想法和表达方式分开; \n2.在讨论和处理事务时,要充分讨论、真诚沟通、冷静分析,不能感情用事、以点带面或观点封闭; \n3.工作中严于律己,谦虚礼让,积极向上,敢于担当,成为合作的朋友。 \n这是家长组织生存发展的基本要求。彼此之间只有真诚、信任,才有尊重、平等,才能团结合作。自我改变适应家长组织的使命要求,一起努力,让令人尊重的家长团队呈现在社会上,吸引各领域的志愿者参与到家长的活动中。推动社会民众包容、接纳、理解残障人士的过程中,人人奉献爱心,个个负起责任,社会一定会改变。 三、家长组织与政府关系基于本手册支持家长的目的,关于家长组织和政府的关系这部分内容侧重于家长组织如何就家长及其组织所关注的核心问题增强对政府的影响力,主要包括以下方面: 1.家长组织通过带领家长参与国家和地区的相关政策制定和实施,进行政策倡导,具体包括向政府反映家庭和孩子的需求,积极参与政策制定过程中的意见征集,通过数据、调研了解相关事务发展状况和政府及时沟通,带领家长学习和掌握相关政策等; \n2.有礼、有据、有效地传达家长和残障人的意见和需求,使得政府在设计相关项目时关注这些意见和需求,对接服务提供和服务接受,促进政府相关服务的效果; \n3.帮助政府机构和部门在设计和提供服务时关注和使用家长组织成功的经验和做法。成功的经验和做法能够达成有效的倡导;

四、家长组织与其他残障/相关组织的关系简言之,从家长组织的组织机构、专业、领导力和影响力各方面的发展需要来说,其他的相关组织和机构和家长组织的有力社会资源和合作伙伴。从家长组织的使命来说,家长组织与其他相关组织有共识,有目标,有相互配合的实施方案,有类似的利益与成果应用,互惠双赢,共同推动残障人士事业发展。 \nod ourn oun \no ound u \nه t给家长的支持手册\n50 第三节家长支持的途径和特点了解家长支持的有效途径和特点可以帮助家长组织明确工作的方向、内容和实施计划。 一、家长支持的途径1·通过法律的保障确定家长作为核心的伙伴参与到孩子的教育全过程的权利和义务; 2.通过扶持、支持和扩大家长机构的专业化发展,为家长及其代表机构赋能; \n3.通过建立、完善和加强围绕家长的支持体系建设,保障孩子和家长权利的落实; 4.转介的信息沟通渠道的建立。 二、家庭支持的特点\n1,以家庭为中心,而不是仅以孩子或家长为中心家长组织往往并非一个资源型的能够不断满足各种需要的机构,每个家长在家长组织中往往要经历学习提升-贡献和实践-组织提升带动个人受益的过程,而家长的目标亦应该设定在更远期的让家庭生活常态化,把受残障影响的程度减到最低。 2.以积极防御为主,而不是以矫正和干预为主积极防御正是有效的家长组织的重要作用之一,通过经验和知识的积累和分享,让家庭在一个正确的轨道上发展,而不是被迫在问题出现时给予干预和矫正。 3.在以目标为中心的框架下争取广泛的社会支持家长支持的核心在于最终的目标设定是否正确和科学,如果目标偏离了,那么事情将变得更为复杂,特别是很多家长组织在早期发展阶段,为了满足自身发展需要承担了一些偏离目标业务的工作,耗费了组织的资源和精力,结果却与目标背离。 4,在定位和结构两方面避免官僚化参与家长组织的每一个家长都有自己的发展背景,在主流社会还普遍存在官僚化做法的背景下难免受到影响,但是,在家长组织的定位和架构上,如果无法避免官僚化的做法,将直接影响具体工作的开展。 \n好\nا อ 5,关注不断赋能和自给自足组织的健康发展离不开对于目标的坚持和不断实践,这无疑需要保持一定的独立和决策能力,背后更是持续的资源支持,所以,在关注组织发展的同时也应该着重关注组织是否能够发展成为具备自我赋能、自给自足的能力, \n6,提供安全和接纳的环境使年轻的父母能分享和探索提升孩子的目标、信念和考虑每个家长组织都是不断发展和进步的,参与其中的家长也有先来后到,特别是针对心境加入的、年轻孩子的父母,在经验和能力乃至资源上需要成熟的家长提供一个接纳的成长和学习环境。 7.自愿式的参与家长组织的基础在于家长的诉求和需求,生命力在于家长的积极参与,这一切的前提就是家长的自愿,本质上,家长组织就是家长自愿组织。 8.基于社区和邻里家长组织的发展要基于其家长的组成形式,如果是基于物理地域的,那么开展工作的基础和核心也应着重在此,如果是基于网络的,那么,先期开展的工作也建议基于网络。 \n9,向那些不能或不愿意寻求帮助的家庭提供援助,滋养他们接受和运用支持的能力并不是每个家长一开始都对家长组织有足够的了解和认识,家长组织在发展过程中同样应该注意关注新力量的加入,倡导和影响包括那些还存在偏见和误区的家长,为他们提供支持,用行动和实践向更多的家长传递信息也是非常重要的。 \nه 52 \n০ 有第四部分有为了孩子的明天我们应该行动起来o aN \no \nค ur \n给家长的支持手册০ \n2 \n53 \nত \n当家长已经重新认识了自己,重新认识了孩子,重新认识了残障,我们相信,家长们已经迫不及待地想知道,为了孩子的明天,今天我们可以做些什么。我们必须意识到,一个觉醒的家长,就能开始正确地倡导、改变,而当家长形成合力,其力量强大,倡导和改变就更有效。 \n那么什么是倡导呢?倡导就是为了达到积极的成效而采取的合力行动。倡导可以在很多层面发生,可以随时随地发生。倡导的技能可以和需要通过学习获得,并且通过练习不断提高。通常,有意识的倡导能够产生较好的效果。 \n倡导包括三个基本要素:权利意识、自我意识和合力行动。 \n1.对于家长来说,权利意识包括对孩子的权利意识和家庭的权利意识; \n2.自我意识是对自我的需求、能力、特长、资源、劣势等各方面的认识。有效的倡导需要较好的自我意识和有效的沟通能力,才能有说服力。首先要明白自我意识的重要性,然后要努力提高自我意识。自我意识是可以通过努力而学习提高的; \n3.合力的行动可以达到可持续的、对个人和社会共同有益的和有公信力的改变。仅有意识和想法不能产生改变,需要有行动。持之以恒的行动是有效倡导的必要条件。虽然每个人随时随地都要有意识倡导,但要努力参与合力的倡导。个人的行动力量很有限,不够全面。有问题不能得到及时检验、监督和调整。家长的力量和起来就能尽可能避免这些问题。 \n倡导可以从小事做起,需要有好的方法和策略。其中一个行之有效的方法就是家长之间的相互学习。 考虑到家长更为现实的需求,同时也是为家长提供更多积极的范例以产生启发。本部分兼具工具性与倡导性,主要内容为中外经典的家长个体与家长组织的倡导案例。我们把这两部分分别呈现。一方面是积极的示范效应,另一方面也希望告诉家长,无论是什么样的个体,在什么样的社会环境中,只有从态度转变开始,才能避免南辕北辙的结果,才能够有所作为,才能让倡导的影响与改变使家庭、孩子和社会受益。因此,在案例选择过程中,我们充分注意到案例的广泛代表性,及个体可操作性,以及和中国社会环境的结合。 \n有一点必须指出的是,这些案例,仅供大家拓宽思路之用,请各位已经摩拳擦掌,准备行动的家长,再一次认真地检视孩子、家庭及社区的关系,开动自己的智慧,开发可利用的所有资源,找到最适合自己孩子的倡导方式,而绝非简单地依葫芦画瓢。 \n有第一节身边的行动\n案例一给小区住户们的一封信阿鑫(化名)是一位自闭症人士,平日里会到特殊学校上学,家住在G市某社区之中。他的父母均是职场白领。 \n因为阿鑫面临社交障碍,其沟通方式很难得到他人的理解,存在的某些情绪和刻板行为,在外出时经常会引起别人的惊恐或者异样目光。起初,阿鑫妈妈为此感到非常烦恼与痛苦,很少愿意带阿鑫出门,并认为这是一种对阿鑫的保护。但是后来妈妈发现,阿鑫对外面的世界很向往,并且会因为出门的要求被拒绝而情绪变得特别糟糕。这让妈妈十分矛盾,只能整日哀叹为什么阿鑫是一个自闭症,常常幻想,如果他能和别家孩子一样,该有多好。 (这里告诉我们,家长常常可能因为顾忌外界的态度,做对孩子不利的选择。 ) 后来在某次家长聚会中,阿鑫妈从其他家长的分享中,了解到了关于残障的社会视角,心中豁然开朗,认识到其实她以前所纠结的东西,并非是孩子有自闭症的错,而是周围的环境没有接纳孩子。同时,她也看到其他自闭症孩子因为经常参加社会活动,各方面的情况都非常不错。所以回来之后,为了孩子,决心鼓起勇气,采取行动。 (这里告诉我们,其他家长出于先进视角的做法,可以让家长彼此认识到自己的错误。 ) \n因为阿鑫家生活在一个高端小区,小区内设施齐全,安保措施严密,因此阿鑫妈妈经过分析,觉得从小区内开始为孩子的出行倡导,是一个不错的选择。不用担心自己的能力不够,照看不过来,也不用担心孩子出现太大的危险。 (这里告诉我们,倡导从定位环境和寻找周边的资源支持开始。 \n决定行动起来的阿鑫妈妈连夜在电脑上给全小区住户及商户写了一封信,介绍了自己家的情况和孩子的自闭症,同时将自闭症的特点作了说明与罗列。在信的结尾,阿鑫妈妈深情地写道： “当您在路边看到一个嘴里念念有词却不肯跟您打招呼的大男孩时,请不用异,因为他只是沉浸在了自己的世界里。当您的小店走进来一个看似不懂礼貌的大男孩,四处翻动您的东西,或者问您一些奇怪问题的时候,请您不必紧张,他只是想跟您表达他的问候与友好。其实他已鼓起了很大的勇气。当您在电影院里听到一个大男孩高声尖叫时,请不要着急咒骂。他只是和我们很多人一样,不太适应电影院里的黑暗,或者是突如其来的变化。但他也很渴望和大家一起享受看电影时的快乐。 …我们感谢您对这位大男孩的宽容,能够让他在小区里自由地奔跑。我们感谢您对这位大男孩的鼓励,让他能够有勇气向更多人表示自己的友好。我们感谢您对这位大男孩的友善,让他能够快乐地生活在这片天空之下。如果您觉得这位大男孩给您带来了困扰,或者想帮助他,又不知道应该怎么办,请您别着急,您可以联系18 ,我们会马上赶到进行处理。而下一次,您肯定就能够ه \n和这个大男孩成为要好的朋友。 ” (这里告诉我们,倡导从帮助周边了解孩子的残障和需求开始。外界越不对孩子的残障少见多怪,我们孩子就越容易被接纳。家长对残障的羞耻心是孩子融入社区的最大障碍。这段经历还告诉我们,倡导从联合周边的力量开始,设身处地,以感恩的心来争取帮助和支持,才最有说服力。 ) 阿鑫妈妈将这封信打印了许多份,带着阿鑫到小区的住户和商户拜访,介绍孩子的情况。刚开始还有些难以启齿,可当她收到来自小区居民们的理解与善意时,她越来越充满了勇气。即使偶尔碰上几个不耐烦的,阿鑫妈妈也不会哀叹,只会更加耐心。 (这里告诉我们,倡导要有面对困难的心理准备,在跨越自己的心理障碍和外界的障碍中,增加倡导的信心和能力。 ) 阿鑫妈妈的行动取得了非常好的效果,从那以后,阿鑫在父母不在家的时候,也会一个人在小区里活动,很少惹出麻烦。当她下班回来的时候,总有路人跟她打招呼,告诉她今天他们又在哪看到阿鑫了,又和他发生了什么样的趣事。而阿鑫的情绪,也越来越好。 (这里告诉我们,当我们跨越了自身的障碍,我们便开始给孩子和家庭拓展更积极和广阔的发展空间。 ) 温馨提示: 观念决定态度,态度决定行为,行为决定结果。 \n心理学上有一个“皮格马利翁效应” ,放到家长与孩子的关系之中,简单说就是,当你看孩子是什么样子,他/她将来就会发展成什么样子\n阿鑫的父母起初认为自闭症是一种灾难。因此,他们的生活里,处处糟糕。可当思维模式转变之后,这个世界,会给你支撑勇气的足够美好。 \n也许在之前的生活里,你会觉得每天面对的都是满满的恶意。但其实是这个世界对你和孩子缺少一点点的了解,所以有时候会产生一些误会。但它并不是一个死结。解开绳结的关键线索,就在你的手中。 e 康康是一个自闭症孩子,四岁那年,当他被确认为自闭症的时候,家庭经历了绝望、挣扎到重新认识自我的过程。父母并没有放弃康康,而是开始努力地学习,了解关于自闭症的知识,同时努力地为康康创造融入社会的条件与环境。因此,从康康上幼儿园开始,父母就想尽一切办法,让他和普通的孩子在一起。他们起初是隐瞒,只是告诉老师,这个孩子不爱说话,比较难带。到后来学会尝试找机会与老师沟通,与其他家长沟通,告诉他们什么是自闭症。在康康上小学的时候,父母经过讨论,觉得一方面要注重康康的社会性康复需求,另一方面也要尊重康康的身心特点。在他二年级的时候,在很多家长不理解的情况下,他们毅然地选择了让康康在普通学校上半天,再到特殊学校半天的教育方式。 (这里告诉我们,短暂挣扎之后要迅速调整、学习,明确确立孩子健康的发展目标,为孩子争取每个机会。 ) 案例二我们一起看电影“其实很多自闭症孩子的家长努力让孩子在普通学校上学,并且严格要求孩子,他们的内心并不一定真正接受自己的孩子,只是拼命地想让孩子跟别的孩子一样。可是,每个孩子都是不一样的,我们到底是爱我们的孩子,还是爱我们自己呢? \" (这个问题值得每个家长深思!) \n不管在成长的路上,康康遇到什么问题,父母从来不认为这是康康自闭症的错,他们只会努力地去想办法调整,为康康创造更合适的环境。无论走到哪里,只要有机会和条件,父母都会毫不隐瞒地告诉别人康康的情况。 (这里告诉我们:家长要从正确的观念清楚地定位障碍所在,主动对外界进行有关残障教育,而不是把孩子的残障当成错误的根源。 ) 在他们新家的小区,父母一直没有机会向别人解释康康为什么跟其他小朋友不一样。 2010年6月,中国第一部以自闭症人士为主角的电影《海洋天堂》公映,父母去电影院买了很多票,给小区物业、面包坊以及他们的邻居们赠送电影票,跟电影票一起送给他们的还有一封感情真挚的信。信里,康康妈妈向他们简单讲述了康康的事。信里这样写道: “或许你们时常会看到,一个12岁的小男孩,在小区门口向保安哥哥们问好,向小区认识或不认识的叔叔阿姨们问好,怪怪的声调,幼稚的行为,纯真的表情。他,就是我们的孩子康康。康康是一个自闭症孩子。自闭症是一种… ,最后,我想说的是,如果不是因为儿子,我们可能也不会去关注这样的弱势群体。中国有8000多万残障人,他们跟所有的人一样,渴望生活,追求美好,但他们的路走得比其他人艰辛,在这条艰辛的路上,他们得到许许多多的关爱,正是你们这点点滴滴的关爱,让他们多了一份信心和勇气,努力顽强地生活着,也让他们的家人倍感欣慰。 ” (这里我们领略到,一个生命不同的经历一个家庭的行动变成为更多人寻求美好世界的契机。 ) 就是这样,康康的父母希望通过各种方式唤起大家对自闭症群体的关注,也希望给康康营造更好更有爱的环境。 \n\nond 好\nอ 温馨提示: ส \n父母之爱子,则为之计深远。但绝对不是给孩子一辈子的保护。你可以做的是不断为孩子积累各种社会资本。如同康康父母意识到的最重要一点,就是孩子的社会化。 \n孩子最大的幸福,不是长成跟别人家的孩子一样,而是成为最好的自己。在这条自我成就的道路上,我们只能陪他/她一程,而无法保护一生,要切忌不应该让我们狭义的保护使孩子的生命枯萎。我们可以做的,战略上放手,让孩子拥抱社会的不确定性。占术上抓紧,抓紧每一次机会,让孩子学会适应社会,让社会逐渐了解孩子。 \n请记住,是每-次机会噢! \ne o oud \nun u \nه 1给家长的支持手册\n58

2011年2月, Lacey前往范德堡医学中心准备分娩时,她并不清楚孩子是否能存活。分娩成功后,医生们发现,克里斯汀的实际状况比预想得更为糟糕。小克里斯汀患有一种罕见严重的腭裂,能广泛影响脸部器官,如鼻、眼及下颚,还有嘴巴。他没有上颚,不能闭合嘴唇,也没有双目。他在出生后第四天便接受了第一次手术。现在经过一系列的手术,他上颚的分裂部分已经闭合,但上颚仍需要接受更多手术治疗。他在范德堡医学中心的新生儿重症监护室里呆了足足一月。当他终于可以出院回家的时候。事情变得更为艰难,因为夫妻并不知道该如何抚养一位视障的婴儿。周围人的指指点点和交头接耳也让Lacey心烦意乱。人们经过她身边的时候会问道: “你的孩子怎么了? ”甚至有位妇女直截了当说,她明知道孩子有先天性疾病却没将他流产掉,真是面目可憎。然而25岁的Lacey并不认为这是一个错误。相反,她觉得,如果选择了放弃,才是一种可怕的错误。 (这里我们看到,即使是孩子的情况超乎想象的糟糕,这位母亲依然坚持,不放弃。这样的态度应该不仅对待残障才需要。 ) \n小克里斯汀是个勇士,每当人们盯着他看时,他便开始咯咯地笑,于是人们也便开始笑了起来。 “无论谁见到他,很快就会爱上他。这位母亲在后来说,她没抛弃克里斯汀是一个正确的决定,因为“他是我此生挚爱” 。 (这里我]看到,一个被人起初厌弃和感到恐惧的生命,在父母的爱中给人展示同样的美好。 ) 为了能够让更多人了解到这一点,也了解他们与孩子的生活,这位母亲制作了一段视频,展示了他们是如何互相扶持着面对困难和外界的嘲讽,一起走下去的。在这段视频中,这位母亲手持卡片,讲述了自己从最初得知怀孕后的狂喜,以及随后而来的恐惧和旁人的嘲讽,最为重要的是,她对孩子的爱和孩子给她带来的那种对生命的感谢与欣喜。 (这里告诉我们,只有有意识倡导,办法就在手中。 ) 视频在网络上反响热烈,这点倒是让Lacey有点惊讶。她在接受每日邮报的采访时说道: “我本来没想到这个视频会有如此影响力,因为这只是一位母亲抱着她的爱子拍的一段小视频而已。 ” “我想藉此为所有为类似状况而烦忧,已育有或孕有残障孩子的父母把劲。我想告诉他们:尽管有时非常艰难,但也有快乐的时光。希望总是有的。并且,快乐的时光远远多于艰难。 ” (这里我们看到平凡的倡导带来的不平凡的效果,影响已经超越残障。 ) 视频上线后不久便收到2万多的点击率。 Lacey和小克里斯汀也受到了来自全国的各种关心支持和鼓励。 \n2 扫描二维码,观看视频《无眼男婴母亲用爱直面嘲讽) \n温馨提示: 请不要让我们生命中的不可抗拒之轻,变成不可承受之重。

柯柯(化名)是一位高中语文教师,女儿五周岁时确诊为自闭症。女儿七岁时,柯柯带着女儿到片区内的小学报名,校长和老师未曾接触过这类小孩,一时很难接受,一再强调这是普教系统不是特殊教育系统,让她们到残联等其他地方想办法。但当时整个城市都没有专门接收自闭症学龄儿童的机构。她们只好硬着头皮跟校长求情,最后学校看在家长也是老师的份上,同意让她们找陪读阿姨,试读一个月。 \n64 案例六是女儿,也是学生然后就是女儿不断地出各种状况,柯柯不断地被请到校长室喝茶,委婉劝其女儿退学。柯柯一再以老师的情面,厚着脸皮要求再让她们试试,就这样,再试试,再试试,就试了九年,直至女儿初中毕业。 \n女儿初中毕业后,柯柯所在高中的领导照顾她,让女儿到学校随班就读。虽然没有学籍,但柯柯已经非常感激。在开学前,柯柯跟所有的科任老师和班里同学做了充分的沟通,女儿又一次有机会地融入一个新的集体。 尽管女儿的情况是一个个案,但柯柯平时还是会总结一些经验,分享给更多家长。因为自身是老师的原因,所以她知道在融合教育的路上,如何说服老师更有效。 “很多星儿(自闭症孩子常被称为'星星的孩子, )的家长不愿意告诉老师孩子是自闭症,也许是不想孩子被歧视,也许是怕老师放弃孩子不管孩子。但我觉得一定要事先跟老师做好沟通,把孩子的特殊性先告诉老师,尤其要让老师知道孩子什么事情是做不到的,请老师不要一视同仁, 。 ” (这里我们看到,家长的独特经验对其他家长非常有帮助。来自家长的提示也很有说服力。 ) \n柯柯每逢开学初就送给校长和老师每人一本介绍自闭症的书《蜗牛不放弃》 ,并请求校长不要把女儿的成绩计入班级,以免有应试教育考评压力的任课老师认为女儿会拖后腿。这里我们看到,家长是如何可以先行,为孩子争取好的学习环境,根据现实条件,不断消除不利因素。 ) 分享经验是一方面,柯柯同时也意识到,融合教育不能只靠每位特殊孩子的家长去厚着脸皮争取,融合教育也不能寄望于某位校长和老师的同情心。还有很多的特殊孩子找不到他们的课桌椅,还有不少的新闻在报道特殊孩子的“被退学” “被隔离” ,还有许许多多的“因为不了解而带来的不理解”包围着我们的孩子和家长。因此,柯柯还会在平日里利用老师的身份,鼓励指导学生们展开与普及自闭症知识与理念相关的活动,一方面锻炼学生们的能力,积累公益志愿经验,另一方面也是尽自己的所能,去影响和改变周围的环境。 (这里又是一个利用自己的经验和方法改变大环境的好例子。 ) 2013年,学校新年大合唱比赛,珂珂的女儿站在舞台上,和其他55位同学一起,唱《 Let the music heal your soul 》 。全班同学只有她一个人拿着歌词纸,那张纸总是挡着她的脸,柯柯看不到她的表情,但看到她随着旋律摇晃的身体,在站得整齐笔直的同学中显得那么突兀,但又那么和谐-柯柯眼眶有微微的湿润,拿起手机,拍下她和小伙伴好\nه 们在一起的这一刻,因为在那一刻,她深刻地感受到了,这就是她想让女儿收获的融合之路。 (这里我们看到,为孩子收获参与式的融合起始于心里有这样的目标,是各方面的相互融入.) \n温馨提示: 融合虽然有时不是一个前提,但有希望成为一个结果,好的结果一定有一个过程,不会一夜天降。 \n消极地等待,寄希望于他人,其实是无法接纳孩子的一种逃避。最终耽误的只能是孩子和父母自己。 \n我们不能寄希望于有一天如何如何,我们能做的是通过努力,一步一步地走向我们心中的那一天。也许环境无法马上被改变,但只要它是朝着你所期望的方向,努力下去,就会越走越近。 \n人要有所坚持,爱必给予复利。 \nส eou \nه ב给家长的支持手册\n66 \n০ 有\nouro ه 第二节联合的n量\n案例一融合教育爱心行动2008年,在广州杨爱特殊孩子家长俱乐部的一些会员们发起了“融爱行计划,以广州市3所学校为试点,集合专家顾问团队,培训特教助理,开展了对残障儿童随班就读的专业支援。到2011年底, “融爱行”项目支持了20多个特殊孩子在普校的学习,包括自闭症、阿斯伯格综合症、唐氏综合症的孩子,受到家长、学校的一致好评。 \n随着“融爱行”队伍的壮大,接受服务的孩子的增多,督导和管理的工作压力越来越大,出现项目管理的服务能力跟不上,老师的工作量也不胜负荷等情况。同时,排队轮候的家长还是多达数百人,远远不能满足家庭的需求。另外,由于特教助理和服务个案是完全-对一的,项目收费3000~5000元一个月,特教助理的工资完全由家长自己支付,对家庭形成了巨大的经济压力,仅凭借民间的力量很难解决这些问题。 为了让更多的特殊儿童在普通学校也能获得支持性融合教育, 2014年1月,经讨论后,家长们决定行动起来。他们成立了一支信访队伍,组成特殊儿童“妈妈团” 。参与者将信访活动命名为“融爱行” 。 “融爱行”成员每月通过局长接访日、网上信访等途径,向市委市政府、市教育局、市残联等多个部门反映特殊孩子的教育诉求,提出了“特殊儿童随班就读巡回督导计划”项目方案,进行政策倡导。 2014年4月广东省教育厅颁布了《广东省特殊儿童少年随班就读资源教室建设与管理实施办法》 ,首次以法规形式给特殊儿童设置资源教室,使其能够获得融合教育环境中的必要支持。 同年5月,家长的诉求信也得到广州市领导的批示,市长和残联、教委领导亲自接见了家长代表,与家长进行了深入沟通,建议将该项目纳入了政府购买服务的方式实施。从9月1日起,特殊儿童随班就读巡回督导计划在广州20所中小学试点。随班就读巡回督导计划把特殊教育资源引入到普通学校,通过普通学校和特殊学校合作的方式,为随班就读的学生提供支持服务。公立特殊教育机构设立“随班就读支持资源中心” ,组成“随班就读个案工作组” ,派出专业人士为普通学校的老师传授教育方法和特殊教育相关知识,开展随班就读教育教学指导工作,所有针对普通老师的培训费用都由政府买单(政府经费支持) 。 “特殊儿童随班就读巡回督导计划”由家长个体的单个项目变成了政府推动融合教育的具体政策。 \n在整个倡导的过程中,首先, “融爱行”的发起人在家长组织的帮助下,整理收集了业界案例和资料,把身心障碍学生随班就读的问题列出后,制定了有组织、有准备、有计划、有目标的实施方案,同时,认真研究相关政策、法律,提出符合当地实际情况而又合理可行的建议。 \n其次,倡导活动为参与上访的家长们提供培训,并一再强调在谈判时既不要抱怨,也女\nه \n不要哀求,而是有礼有节地表达自己对孩子的爱和孩子要接受有质量的融合教育的诉求”正是这一次次冷静而令人动容的坚持,让事情终于出现了曙光。 \n家长们在这个过程中,总结经验如下: \n1.用数据说话-有调查就没有发言权;通过调查,了解家长群体的需求,为制定计划、需求评估、以及用“事实数据”向政府倡导提供科学依据。 \n2.用事实说话--正反面案例及民间尝试;家长组织先试先行,之前的“融爱行”项目为将来在全市推动融合教育方案提供了经验和模式,用实践让政府看到了社会效益。 \n3,向社会大众发声一公众教育与媒体宣传;通过媒体资源,广泛报道特殊孩子随班就读面临的困境和“融爱行”项目正在做的教育尝试,引起社会关注。 \n4·用专业说话智囊团的大力支持;专业的诉求报告需要有专业的团队支持,专业团队覆盖了各个领域,包括特殊教育专家、残联等政府专员、律师、医生、高校学者专家、支持性就业专家与推动者、市场研究专业人士、专业社工和家长前辈。 \n5,向政府发声人大提案,市长诉求;通过合理合情的表达,家长敞开胸怀,展示自我观点,通过法律的途径,赢得政府重视。 \n\ne 6,代表大众发声-反映多数人需求;参加调查家长为主体诉求人,代表全市超过3000名随班就读学生家长。诉求内容代表绝大多数群体,而不是小众群体或者个别人群。 \n7.争取更多利益方众人拾柴火焰高,教育局、普通学校、特教学校, NGO民间机构、家长。 \n残障者家长的新方向。研究政策,找到差距和提出合理化建议。 \n\"特殊儿童随班就读巡回督导计划”的成功倡导,让广大家长看到了倡导的力量,坚定了为孩子权利继续倡导的勇气和信心。 2014年10月,家长们又继续启航,针对为成年残障者的职业教育和支持性就业问题,该家长团体再次组织家长一起调研,收集数据,进行分析。一方面,对支持性就业案例进行个案解读,做职业教育的实践与研究,一方面向市政府、教委及相关领导提交可行性分析报告,报告中数据真实、分析合理,得到市长、教委领导、劳动人事部门的重视,立即召开各部门负责人会议,邀请几位家长分别谈需求,谈权利,谈社会责任,家长有理有据,入情入理地讲明孩子接受教育、参加工作、独立生活的权利。市长和相关领导很快做出决定:在全市职业学校开设特教班,推行“职业教育9+3\"和“支持性就业实施意见” \n家长组织的倡导一直在路上。 \na 温馨提示: \n老祖宗说,一人技短,两人技长。 \n当一群家长聚集起来,形成的合力,不是1+1=2,而是成指数的累积。但要想达到这样的效果,绝非是简单地聚集在一起。没有职业的运作,没有组织化的运营,没有专业的支持,很可能因诸多原因分崩离析,散沙一盘。但-但当家长]的力量能够有效协调起来之时,从政策倡导到服务监督,其作用将决定于你的想象。 \ne oound \nuo o \nrn o 给家长的支持手册\nه ه \nه 案例二吃吃喝喝分享会在北京有一群自闭症的家长,年龄大都在三十上下,孩子普遍在五岁到十岁之间。因为孩子们面临着上小学的问题,因此,通过其中一个办康复机构的家长,他们聚集在了一起。每隔一段时间,他们都会在另外一位家长提供的场地里聚会。一方面交流近期孩子的情况,另一方面,有着丰富的与学校谈判经验的家长,会分享自己的经验。也会有家长提出自己现下面临的问题,其余家长共同出谋划策。同时,还会有家长凭借自己的资源,邀请来教育专家、政府官员等,一起出席家长们的聚会。某次聚会上,各位家长探讨的话题是带着孩子去学校参加面试,该不该隐瞒孩子的情况。有家长表示,能隐瞒一定要隐瞒,否则孩子连机会都没有。但有的家长则说自己的经验是一定要坦白跟学校沟通。经过具体的分享,长时间的沟通,大家最终才发现,原来到底选择何种策略,要看孩子的具体情况,以及要去面试的那所学校在北京市小学中所处的地位,还有家长自身的资源等。绝非一个简单的隐瞒或者不隐瞒。但同时,家长们也达成了一致,不管之前如何,孩子入学之后,一定要与学校和老师认真沟通孩子的情况,表明自己对孩子的培养目标等。否则一味隐瞒,只会给孩子带来莫大的伤害。而那些正在为孩子接下来如何上学而犯愁的家长,从中吸收了大量经验,避免在未来可能走更多弯路。而家长们通过定期聚会,渐渐意识到,彼此之间的资源,可以通过交换互补,当大家联合起来行动的时候,除了解决具体孩子的问题,还找到了推动政策改变,为孩子营造更友善环境的可能。 2015年,这群家长们已经开始着手建立起一个目标更明确的组织,来更好地为孩子倡导权利。 \n无独有偶,从东北到西北,类似的家长沙龙,家长小组,已经越来越多,他们还在不断带动更多家长参加进来。从开始的经验分享,到亲子活动,心理支持,社工培养,走向可见的未来。 温馨提示: 这世界上本没有路。走的人多了,也便有了路。 \n其实最初聚集起来,只是因为孤独与困苦,无处倾诉。但抱团取暖后,我们会意识到,除了倾诉,我们还能一起共同面对挑战,群策群力,解决问题。 \n我们有时候看问题,容易看得太远,比如一个成熟的家长组织,他们所做的事情,让个体难以望其项背。因此在艳羡中退却。我们有时候,看问题又看得太浅,觉得一群家长聚集起来聊聊天可能只是浪费时间。我们听得太多,看得太多,考虑得太多,但做得不一定多。 \n其实世界的改变,往往是从自身开始。如同一个家长,转变了观念,走出了家门,遇上了一群家长,带动了一帮家长。改变就早已开始。 \n1 70 ه \n有ه EN \nه 结语o一切都是最好的安排urd ا \nur 给家长的支持手册\nه \n我们习惯了心被捆绑着,为明天将要发生的事情而忧虑。希望我们尽早明白,其实明天并不可怕。因为明天会如何,关键看我们自己如何选择。 \n不过,且慢!当我们突然间,似乎觉得信心又回来之前,在我们迈步走向明天之前,还是要稍微停留一下,冷静想想。不管你认为,过去已经经受了多少苦难,无论你觉得未来如何敞亮,都让我们回到原点。 \n当我们的父母决定迎接我们的新生命的时候,并没有与我们商量过。我们也一样,因为作父母的在生孩子的问题上很自私。 \n有人是“为了让自己的人生更完整” ,不自私吗? \n有人是因为“我喜欢小孩” ,不自私吗? \n有人是因为“不孝有三,无后为大” ,不自私吗? \n有人说是为了“人类的繁衍” ,听上去十分神圣,可基因繁衍这事,更自私。 \n更何况,还有人是因为意外… … \n所以,对孩子的爱与尊重,是我们为生孩子这个选择必须承担的后果,应该负起的责任,这就是“人权”最初始的缘由。父母并不伟大,父母也不必卑微。不必因为孩子的残障和世俗的眼光忍辱负重,更不必因无法承受社会的偏见,感觉到世界崩塌。这些,与我们的孩子,有何干系? \n其实,我们应该感谢孩子,无论他们是怎样,都是我们自私选择的生命果实。是他们让我们的生命更完整,让我们体验到生命逐渐绽放的意外与欣喜。 起初,当我们听到生命里的那一声啼哭之时,当我们触摸到生命里的第一分柔软之际,当我们面对生命里的各种不知所措,我们的心情是怎样的?孩子哭得声音洪亮,我们欣喜无比,孩子哭得细声细气,我们亦欣喜无比。孩子闹腾,我们想,这小家伙,将来肯定很厉害。孩子安安静静,我们又想,这孩子将来肯定很乖巧。我们向每一个人夸耀,从不掩藏自己的欣喜。 \n那是什么时候,闹腾变成了不听话,安静变成了木讷,细声细气可能是胆小,声音洪亮是烦人了呢?又是什么,转变了我们的观念,让我们把生命里最该感谢最该爱的人视为了一种负担,只想逃离,视为一种悲剧,整天哭泣。 \n有一位家长曾经给我们写过一篇文章,题目叫做《学会只操心今晚的饭菜》 ,因为她意识到,我们不应该把自己所谓的幸福,包装成对孩子的无限期待,因为这样的压力,孩子根本承受不来。我们要先做最好的自己。 \n所以,我们没有理由去按我们的意志,塑造孩子的人生。我们也不应因孩子无法满足我们的期待,而失望,痛苦,或者责怪。父母对孩子的捆绑和主宰,极有可能事与愿违。我们能做的事情,是学会接纳孩子、尊重孩子、支持孩子,和孩子一起在他们的旋律上震荡,共同成长,期待,因为我们的支持,孩子成就出最好的自己。 如果说我们必须要带给孩子些什么,那么,我们可以以身作则,让孩子从我们的身上,学会尊重与爱。我们尊重生命里的每一种不同,我们爱生活里的每一种体验。如果我们面对了来自生活里的恶意,那我们就和孩子一起,学会如何面对这些恶意,将它视为一种挑战。就像游戏通关一样,每攻克一个难关,我们就击掌相庆。而不是停留在困难面前,无比焦虑,又驻足不前。如果这次失败了,那也没有关系,我们相互鼓励,再接再厉。 \n幸福不是一个比较级,成功也没有模板。即使有,也只是自己的今天与昨天比,明天与今天比。即使是,那个模板,也只是我们自己,也只适用于我们自己。每天前进一些,每天改变一点。当我们自己变了,这个世界就变了。怕只怕,我们误以为我们已经改变,然后觉得因为世界没有变,又退回到从前,继续心安理得地痛苦与彷徨。 \n因此,在这里,我们稍作停留,回到最初的原点。 \n生命里没有正常与不正常,只有属于我们每个人的独特与多样。 \n当这个世界,包括我们在内,觉得孩子是一种错误的时候,那肯定是我们错了每个生命,都值得拥有属于他的美好。我们要做的是,努力为这份美好创造环境与条件。 \n\n因为,一切都是最好的安排。如果我们不认为它是,可能只是我们还没有发现,或者,还没有足够的能力和勇气去发现。 \n相信,坚定,践行。 \n这份美好,就在前方等着我们。 \nค

        "text": " \n\nIntellectual disability1 refers to neurodevelopmental conditions that affect functioning in two areas:\n\nCognitive functioning, such as learning, problem solving and judgement.\nAdaptive functioning, activities of daily life such as communication skills and social participation.\n\nAdditionally, the intellectual and adaptive deficit begin early in the developmental period, typically before age 18 years for diagnosis.\nIntellectual disability affects about 1% of the population, and of those about 85% have mild intellectual disability. In high-income countries, 2–3% of children have an intellectual disability.\n\nDiagnosing Intellectual Disability\n\nIntellectual disability is identified by significant limitations in both intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior.\nIntellectual functioning is measured with individually administered and psychometrically valid, comprehensive, culturally appropriate, psychometrically sound tests of intelligence. While a specific full-scale IQ test score is no longer required for diagnosis, standardized testing is used as part of diagnosing the condition. A full-scale IQ score of around 70 to 75 indicates a significant limitation in intellectual functioning.2 However, the IQ score must be interpreted in the context of the person’s difficulties in general mental abilities. Moreover, scores on subtests can vary considerably so that the full-scale IQ score may not accurately reflect overall intellectual functioning. Therefore, clinical judgment is needed in interpreting the results of IQ tests.\nWhat is intellectual functioning? Intellectual functioning incorporates the characteristics of intelligence, the abilities assessed by standardized intelligence tests, and the consensus view that intellectual functioning is influenced by other human functioning dimensions and by systems of supports.\nTraditionally, cognitive or intellectual functioning has been measured through the intelligence quotient (IQ) tests, with an IQ of less than 70 recommended for a clinical diagnosis of Intellectual Disability. Currently, clinical diagnosis also requires a score of two or more standard deviations below the population norm (approximately less than the 2nd/3rd percentile) on a standardized measure of adaptive skills such as the vineland adaptive behavior scales.\nWhat is adaptive behavior? Adaptive behavior is the collection of conceptual, social, and practical skills that have been learned and are performed by people in their everyday lives, which include the following:\nThree areas of adaptive functioning are considered:3\n\nConceptual – language, reading, writing, math, reasoning, knowledge, memory.\nSocial – empathy, social judgment, communication skills, the ability to follow rules and the ability to make and keep friendships.\nPractical – independence in areas such as personal care, job responsibilities, managing money, recreation, and organizing school and work tasks.\n\nAdaptive functioning is assessed through standardized measures with the individual and interviews with others, such as family members, teachers and caregivers.\nAge of onset is the third element for a diagnosis of ID. This third criterion is essential because it establishes the age-related parameters for determining when ID originates or is first manifested. The age of onset criterion “before the individual attains age 22” found in the 12th edition of the AAIDD Manual is based on recent research showing that important brain development continues into our 20s.\nThe clinical symptoms and signs of intellectual disability are first recognized during infancy and childhood. Intellectual disability is identified as mild (most people with intellectual disability are in this category), moderate, or severe or profound.\nCauses\nThere are many different causes of intellectual disability. It can be associated with a genetic syndrome, such as Down syndrome or Fragile X syndrome. It may develop following an illness such as meningitis, whooping cough or measles; may result from head trauma during childhood; or may result from exposure to toxins such as lead or mercury. Other factors that may contribute to intellectual disability include brain malformation, maternal disease and environmental influences (alcohol, drugs or other toxins). A variety of labor- and delivery-related events, infection during pregnancy and problems at birth, such as not getting enough oxygen, can also contribute.\n\nManagement\n\nIntellectual disability is a life-long condition. However, early and ongoing intervention may improve functioning and enable the person to thrive throughout their lifetime. Underlying medical or genetic conditions and co-occurring conditions frequently add to the complex lives of people with intellectual disability.\nOnce a diagnosis of intellectual disability is made, help for individuals with intellectual disability is focused on looking at the individual’s strengths and needs, and the supports he or she needs to function at home, in school/work and in the community.\nServices for people with intellectual disabilities and their families can provide support to allow full inclusion in the community. Many different types of treatments and services can help, such as:\n\nTreatment of medical complications.\nGeneral preventive medical care.\nTreatment of co-morbid medical and mental health conditions.\nTreatment of challenging behaviors.\nRehabilitation services.\nEarly intervention (infants and toddlers).\nSpecial education.\nFamily support (for example, respite care support groups for families).\nTransition services from childhood to adulthood.\nVocational programs.\nDay programs for adults.\nHousing and residential options.\nCase management.\n\nUnder federal law (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, 1990), early intervention services work to identify and help infants and toddlers with disabilities. Federal law also requires that special education and related services are available free to every eligible child with a disability, including intellectual disability.\nIn addition, supports can come from family, friends, co-workers, community members, school, a physician team, or from a service system. Job coaching is one example of a support that can be provided by a service system. With proper support, people with intellectual disabilities are capable of successful, productive roles in society.\nA diagnosis often determines eligibility for services and protection of rights, such as special education services and home and community services. The American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD) stresses that the main reason for evaluating individuals with intellectual disabilities is to be able to identify and put in place the supports and services that will help them thrive in the community throughout their lives.\nTips for Parents\n\nAsk for help, learn about your child’s disability.\nConnect with other parents of children with disabilities.\nBe patient; learning may come slower for your child.\nEncourage independence and responsibility.\nEducate yourself on the educational services your child deserves.\nLearn the laws that are written to help your child live their best life.\nLook for opportunities in your community for social, recreational and sports activities (such as Best Buddies or Special Olympics).\n\n\nRelated Conditions\n\nSome mental health, neurodevelopmental, medical and physical conditions frequently co-occur in individuals with intellectual disability, including autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, impulse control disorder, and depression and anxiety disorders. Identifying and diagnosing co-occurring conditions can be challenging, for example recognizing depression in an individual with limited verbal ability. Family caregivers are very important in identifying subtle changes. An accurate diagnosis and treatment are important for a healthy and fulfilling life for any individual.\n\nAutism spectrum disorder\nAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder\nImpulse control disorder\nDepression\nAnxiety disorders\n"

We conducted an online survey comprising items on demographic data; two self-designed questionnaires (children’s behavioral problems/psychological demand of parents during COVID-19); and four standardized questionnaires, including the General Health Questionnaire, Perceived Social Support, Parenting Stress Index, and Neuroticism Extraversion Openness Five Factor Inventory. The results showed that there were significant differences among parents of children with different challenges. Parents of children with autism spectrum disorder were more likely to have mental health problems compared to parents whose children had an intellectual disability or a visual or hearing impairment. Behavioral problems of children and psychological demands of parents were common factors predicting the mental health of all parents. Parent–child dysfunctional interactions and parenting distress were associated with parents of children with autism spectrum disorder. Family support, having a difficult child, and parenting distress were associated with having children with an intellectual disability. It is necessary to pay attention to the parents’ mental health, provide more social and family support, and reduce parenting pressures.Keywords: mental health, COVID-19, parents of different types of special needs children, parenting stress, perceived social support1. IntroductionSince the end of 2019, the severe acute respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has swept across the world. The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus pandemic as a public health emergency of international concern. Faced with such a critical situation, the Chinese government issued nationwide emergency policies in a short time, including shutting down schools and working places, home quarantine, and other public requirements to limit population mobility. Although these policies could effectively cut off the spread of the virus, these measures are associated with mental health problems, such as anxiety, self-reported stress, and disturbed sleep [1,2]. Many studies have reported the mental health status of medical staff and the general public; however, few have focused on more vulnerable groups such as children with disabilities (i.e., special needs children) and their parents.In China, there are millions of special needs children, but both them and their parents are still on the edge of social concern. As noted by studies, having a special needs child refers to a long-term challenges for parents, no matter what type and degree of disability the special needs children have [3]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the nationwide home quarantine that caused school and rehabilitation training institution closure required millions of children with disabilities to stay at home for months [4]. Some children with disabilities might experience behavioral regression and extensive problems because of their inability to access daily school education, rehabilitation training, personalized intervention, and treatments. Instead, parents have to undertake multiple tasks, including parenting, education, rehabilitation, and training, which could increase their parenting stress and cause mental health problems.According to previous studies, caring for special needs children causes many problems among parents on ordinary days; however, parents with special needs children experience more physical, social, and emotional challenges compared to parents of typically developing children [5]. They also face a greater risk of psychological burden and experience various mental health problems such as anxiety [4,6], depression [3], marital discord [7], and sleep problems [8]. Parents with differently challenged special needs children may display diverse types of mental health problems; however, anxiety and depression are the most common [6,9]. The anxiety and depression scores of parents of special needs children were significantly higher than those of typically developing children [9], whereas the rating of anxiety and depression were always moderately in agreement across parents and children [10,11]. Studies also suggested that parents of children with autism spectrum disorder almost always experience more mental health problems than the other forms of handicaps, such as intellectual disabilities [10,12].Prior studies have addressed some predicted factors among the mental health of parents of special needs children, such as economic and social status [13], unemployment [14], parenting stress [15,16], children’s behavior problems [17,18] and social support [19,20]. In general, parents of special needs children have to continually seek for more special treatment, medical equipment and other educational services, which more likely to lead to higher economic burden [21]. In the meantime, one of the parents should always be a main caregiver for the special needs child which may cause an overall decline in the family’s ability to work and reduce family income [22]. Therefore, parents of special needs children were always experience poverty because of lower economic and social status or unemployment as compared to their counterparts [9], which exacerbates mental health problems [22]. In addition, the serious behavioral and emotional problems of special needs children, and the pressure to raise such children were main challenge for parents [17,18,23]. Compared to typically developing children, special needs children are more likely to exhibit externalized behaviors, such as difficulties communicating, poor social relationships, and oppositional defiant disorder [24]. The range of serious behavioral problems continually strengthen the parental stress and trigger parents into a poor mental health cycle. Even the frequent regulatory problems of children, such as sleep problems, are also associated with worse mental health condition among parents [25]. It is noted that children’s behavior problems and parenting stress always occur together to predict the mental health of parents. Furthermore, other studies have reported that social support was an important factor for reducing parenting stress and promoting their ability to cope with mental health problems [19,20]. Unfortunately, parents of special needs children are often excluded from society and public concern, even though positive attitudes of raising special needs children among parents is always related to more social support [20]. These risk factors strengthen mental health problems among parents of special needs children.Based on the above research, we speculated that the mental health problems of parents of children with disabilities may be magnified during the COVID-19 pandemic. These parents may require mental health interventions through appropriate measures; therefore, it is necessary to comprehensively estimate these parents’ mental health status and the key predicting factors. According to reports conducted by the Chinese official institute [26], there are three main types of disabilities among children in China: autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disabilities, and visual or hearing impairments. This study focuses on the parents of three main types of disabilities among children.2. Methods2.1. Participants and Procedure2.1.1. ProcedureOwing to the home quarantine policy, the questionnaire survey was published on the internet. The online survey targeted the parents of special needs children in Guangdong Province in China and was conducted from 18 February to 22 February 2020. Participants were sampled by stratified random sampling method, recruited through special education schools and special education agencies in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Shaoguan, Dongguan, Foshan, Huizhou, and 21 other cities or regions. Parents could see this survey and answer the questionnaire by scanning the two-dimensional barcodes on their cellphones or clicking the relevant link of the questionnaire address on their computers. The questionnaire was anonymous to protect the participants, and it was completely voluntary and noncommercial. All the procedures involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the research ethics committee in the School of Education at Guangzhou University (Protocol Number: GZHU2020004).2.1.2. ParticipantsA total of 1898 responses were received, of which 1450 were valid (parents of children with autism, intellectual disability, or visual impairment and hearing impairment), with a valid rate of 76.40%. The average age of parents was 40.76 years (SD = 5.84), and there were 401 (27.66%) male participants (Mage = 43.23, SD = 5.98) and 1049 (72.34%) female participants (Mage = 39.82, SD = 5.50). According to the classification of special needs children by the China Disabled Persons’ Federation, a total of 454 (31.30%) parents’ children had autism spectrum disorder, with the average age of children being 11.38 years (SD = 3.34). There were 703 (48.50%) parents who had children with an intellectual disability, with the average child’s age of 12.51 years (SD = 3.17). A total of 293 (20.20%) parents had children with a visual or hearing impairment, with the average age of children being 12.47 years (SD = 3.45).2.2. Measures2.2.1. Demographic InformationDemographic information included sex, age, family monthly income, working state during COVID-19, and so on. Children’s information about gender, age and type of disability were also collected.2.2.2. Behavioral Problems of Children during COVID-19We employed a self-designed questionnaire to measure the behavioral problems of children with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire included 6 questions, and each question was scored based on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (no) to 4 (many). The exploratory factor analysis showed that the total KMO (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin) value was 0.75, and the Bartlett’s test of sphericity (χ2 = 2256.69, df = 15, p < 0.001), which indicated that principal component analysis of the data with Varimax rotation could proceed. Two factors were obtained: Factor 1 is named a regulatory problem (including unwillingness to wear mask, unwillingness to wash hands), of which the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.68. Factor 2 is named as an externalized problem (including asking to go out, sleep problems, eating problems, and mood swings), of which the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.74. Both factors accounted for 63.55% of the questionnaires. The Cronbach’s alpha of the whole scale was 0.76, indicating satisfactory internal consistency in all items. Overall, the confirmatory factor analysis of the questionnaire showed that the model fit well (χ2/df = 4.25, CFI (Comparative Fit Index) = 0.99, TLI (Tucker-Lewis Index) = 0.98, SRMR (Standard Root Mean-Square Residual) = 0.02, RMSEA (Root-Mean-Square Error of Approximation) = 0.05), indicating that the questionnaire was valid.2.2.3. Psychological Demand of Parents during COVID-19We employed a self-designed questionnaire to measure the psychological demand of parents of children with disabilities. The questionnaire included 10 questions. Each question was scored based on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (inconsistent) to 4 (consistent). The exploratory factor analysis showed that the total Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin value was 0.83, and the Bartlett’s test of sphericity (χ2 = 4516.19, df = 45, p < 0.001), which indicated that principal component analysis of the data with Varimax rotation could proceed. Two factors were obtained: Factor 1 was named as an emergency demand for COVID-19 pandemic, such as “I would hoard more supplies (like masks)”, “I would frequently confirm information about the pandemic”, of which the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.78. Factor 2 was named as demands for taking care of the child, such as “I have to deal with child’s behavioral problems”, “I need others to provide special equipment for my child with disabilities”, of which the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.78. These factors accounted for 56.52% of the questionnaires. The Cronbach’s alpha of the whole scale was 0.79, indicating satisfactory internal consistency in all items. Overall, the confirmatory factor analysis of the questionnaire showed that the model fit well (χ2/df = 3.89, Comparative fit Index = 0.98, Tucker-Lewis index = 0.97, Standard root mean-square residual = 0.02, Root -mean-square error of approximation = 0.04), indicating that the questionnaire was valid.2.2.4. General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12)The GHQ-12 is a mental health screening self-report that identifies whether participants have mental health problems and estimates the magnitude. It is valid, reliable, and utilized around the world [27]. The questionnaire included 12 items (6 positive and 6 negative questions), such as “I am able to concentrate when doing things” (positive), “I am in a happy mood” (positive), “I always feel stressed” (negative), and “I lose confidence” (negative). Each item was scored on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (less than usual) to 4 (much more than usual). We used a “0-0-1-1” scoring method (bimodal scoring method) to add all the scores [28,29]. Under GHQ scoring standard, the total score ≥3 indicated poor mental health of parents with special needs children [28]. In this study, the Cronbach’s alpha of this scale was 0.90.2.2.5. Perceived Social Support (PSS)The PSS is a questionnaire that assesses the magnitude of support. It consists of three subscales: Family Support, Friend Support, and Other Necessary Support [30]. Each item was scored based on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The Family Support Subscale included four items, such as “My family can actually help me”, “I can talk to my family about my problems”, etc. In this subscale, the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.92. The Friend Support Subscale included four items, such as “My friends can actually help me”, “I can talk to my friends about my problems”, etc. In this subscale, the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.92. The Other Necessary Support subscale included four items, such as “Some people (leaders, relatives, colleagues, etc.) will show up by my side when I have problems”, “I can share happiness and sadness with some people (leaders, relatives, colleagues, etc.)”, etc. In this subscale, the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.87. A total score was created by summing the three subscale scores, with higher scores indicating more perceived support. In this study, the Cronbach’s alpha of the PSS was 0.95.2.2.6. Parenting Stress Index-Short Form 15 (PSI-SF-15)The PSI-SF-15 is a questionnaire that measures parenting stress and burden. It consists of three subscales: parenting distress, parent–child dysfunctional interaction, and difficult child [31]. Each item was scored based on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The Parenting Distress Subscale included five items, such as “I cannot deal with new things”, “I feel like I can’t always do what I want to do”, etc. In this subscale, the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.85. The parent–child dysfunctional interaction subscale included five items, such as “My children seldom do anything that makes me feel more satisfied”, “I don’t think my children like me at most of time”, etc. In this subscale, the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.85. The Difficult Child Subscale included five items, such as “What my children do sometimes makes me angry”, “I feel that my child is very emotional and easy to worry”, etc. In this subscale, the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.90. A total score was created by summing the three subscale scores to indicate overall parenting stress. In this study, the Cronbach’s alpha of the PSI-SF-15 was 0.93.2.2.7. Neuroticism Extraversion Openness Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI)The NEO-FFI is a questionnaire that measures personality traits and comprises five subscales: Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness [32]. Each subscale includes 12 items, and every item was scored based on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strong disagreement) to 5 (strong agreement). Neuroticism examples include, “I’m not a worried person”, “I often feel inferior to others”, etc. Neuroticism is a variable highly related to mental health. Controlling neuroticism can better understand the mental health of parents during the pandemic. The total score of Neuroticism Subscales was created by summing 12 items. In this study, the Cronbach’s alpha of the NEO-FFI was 0.73.2.3. Data AnalysisSPSS version 26.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) and Mplus 8.3 were utilized to analyze the data. Firstly, Mplus 8.3 was used for confirmatory factor analysis to determine whether the structural validity of two self-designed questionnaires was reliable. Then, descriptive analyses were conducted to illustrate participants’ demographic information. A one-way analysis of variance was conducted to compare the mental health scores among the parents with three types of special needs children. Finally, Pearson’s correlation coefficients and hierarchical linear regression analyses were performed to analyze the factors predicting the mental health of different types of parents. The rationale for the order of the variables was the theoretical framework stated in the Introduction: economic and social status, unemployment, and other demographic variables would predict parents’ mental health, followed by parenting stress and social support.The parents with three types of special needs children were analyzed separately, and three hierarchical two-model multiple linear regression models were developed. Block One included demographic variables, such as sex, age, family monthly income, and working state during the COVID-19 pandemic. Neuroticism subscales were also used as a control variable in Block One. Block Two included behavioral problems of the children, psychological demand on the parents, parenting stress (including parenting distress, parent–child dysfunctional interactions, difficult child), and perceived social support (including family support, friend support, the other necessary support). To minimize the possible effects of multicollinearity, the independent variables and moderators were centered at their mean. A two-tailed test with p < 0.05 was considered significant.3. Results3.1. Parents Demographics and General Mental Health StatusTable 1 summarizes parents’ demographics. According to the GHQ-12 classic scoring criteria, a score over 3 indicated that parents’ mental health was poor. In this study, 1058 (73%) parents had good mental health and the remaining 392 (27%) had poor mental health.Table 1Demographic information about parents.VariablesParents of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (n = 454)Parents of Children with Intellectual Disability (n = 703)Parents of Children with Visual or Hearing Impairment (n = 293)\nn\n%\nn\n%\nn\n%Sex\n\n\n\n\n\nMale12427.3117224.4710535.84Female33072.6953175.5318864.16Family monthly income\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder CNY 5000 22048.4640056.9020770.65CNY 5000–9999 13629.9618726.605518.77CNY 10,000–14,999 5211.45588.25175.80CNY 15,000 and above4610.13588.25144.78Working state\n\n\n\n\n\nNormal rework10022.0315421.915719.45Home office8518.7210414.794314.68No work26959.2544563.3019365.87Mental health\n\n\n\n\n\nGood (GHQ < 3)31569.3851873.6822576.79Poor (GHQ ≥ 3)13930.6218526.326823.21Open in a separate windowAbbreviations: GHQ: General Health Questionnaire.A one-way analysis of variance was conducted to compare the mental health scores among the three types of parents with special needs children. A Kolmogorov–Smirnov test showed that the distribution of GHQ did conform to the normal distribution (p < 0.001). Combined with the P–P plots, the data distribution can be considered as a slightly positively skewed distribution [33]. As previous studies have reported, one-way analysis of variance can be used when the sample size is greater than 50 [34]. In this study, a total of 1450 individuals participated, therefore the one-way analysis of variance could be utilized. Levene’s test of homogeneity of variance showed that the variance of each group was not homogeneous (p < 0.001); Tamhane’s T2 was used to perform multiple comparisons.Overall, the results showed that there were significant differences in the mental health of parents with different types of special needs children (F (2, 1447) = 4.05, p = 0.02, η2 = 0.01). Parents of children with autism spectrum disorder were more likely to have mental health problems compared to parents of children with a visual or hearing impairment (p = 0.03). There were also marginal significant differences between parents of children with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities (p = 0.08). However, there was no significant difference between parents of children with an intellectual disability and those with a visual or hearing impairment (p = 0.66). Ranked by mean mental health scores, parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (M = 2.88, SD = 3.43) was first, followed by an intellectual disability (M = 2.45, SD = 3.25) and a visual or hearing impairment (M = 2.24, SD = 2.99). 3.2. Mental Health Status Among Parents of Children with Autism Spectrum DisorderPearson’s correlation coefficient analyses were performed to explore the factors related to parents’ mental health. The results showed that parents’ mental health was positively related to behavioral problems in children (r = 0.22, p < 0.001), psychological demand of parents (r = 0.31, p < 0.001), parenting distress (r = 0.38, p < 0.001), parent–child dysfunctional interaction (r = 0.36, p < 0.001), and difficult child (r = 0.27, p < 0.001); whereas it was negatively related to family support (r = −0.23, p < 0.001), friend support (r = −0.18, p < 0.001), and other necessary support (r = 0.22, p < 0.001).Hierarchical linear regression analyses were used to explore the factors predicting parents’ mental health, and parents’ mental health scores were the dependent variable (see Table 2). Demographic variables were entered in the first model as control variables, and the second model included behavioral problems of children, psychological demands of parents, parenting stress (including parenting distress, parent–child dysfunctional interactions, difficult child), and social support (including family support, friend support, and other necessary support). The maximum variance inflation (VIF) was 4.57, indicating that there was no multicollinearity between independent variables.Table 2Hierarchical linear regression analysis among parents of children with autism spectrum disorder.ModelsVariables\nB\n\nSE\n\nβ\n\nt\n95% CI\nR2\n\nF\nModel 1Age0.030.040.050.83−0.04, 0.10.1180.61 **Sex0.370.370.051.01−0.35, 1.09Family monthly income−0.520.16−0.15−3.29 **−0.83, −0.21Working state0.420.190.012.17 *0.04, 0.80(Child) Age−0.010.06−0.01−0.17−0.12, 0.10(Child) Sex−0.940.44−0.01−2.14 *−1.81, −0.08Neuroticism1.700.310.255.55 **1.10, 2.31Model 2Age0.010.030.020.34−0.06, 0.080.2410.54 **Sex0.260.340.030.76−0.41, 0.92Family monthly income−0.300.15−0.09−2.02 *−0.60, −0.01Working state0.270.180.071.51−0.08, 0.63(Child) Age0.050.050.051.04−0.05, 0.16(Child) Sex−0.610.41−0.06−1.48−1.42, 0.20Neuroticism0.800.310.122.59 **0.19, 1.40Behavioral problems (of children)0.570.260.102.25 *0.07, 1.07Psychological demand (of parents)1.070.320.163.31 **0.43, 1.70Family support−0.230.19−0.09−1.17−0.61, 0.15Friend support0.170.220.060.76−0.27, 0.60The other necessary support−0.320.24−0.12−1.33−0.78, 0.15Parenting distress0.530.230.142.33 *0.08, 0.98Parent–child dysfunctional interaction0.680.240.182.84 **0.21, 1.14Difficult child−0.240.19−0.08−1.25−0.63, 0.14Open in a separate windowNote: all the variables are centered at their mean. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.In the first model, family monthly income, working state during the COVID-19 pandemic, children’s sex, and neuroticism were the significant predictors of mental health, which accounted for 10.5% of the variance.

DiscussionThis study found that 27% of parents with special needs children experienced mental health problems, which differed depending on the different types of disability in the children. Parents of children with autism spectrum disorder were more likely to have mental health problems compared to parents of children with an intellectual disability and a visual or hearing impairment, which is consistent with previous research [35,36].4.1. Similarities Between the Three Groups of Parents of Special Needs ChildrenFirstly, neuroticism was always significant in the three hierarchical linear regression models. As a control variable, neuroticism is a stable factor that impacts on mental health. To some extent, it could be used to control the impact of participants’ emotional state before the COVID-19 pandemic. The significant results concerning neuroticism confirmed that independent variables reported in this study could indeed be used to predict mental health among parents of special needs children during the COVID-19 pandemic.Secondly, behavioral problems of children were the main factors predicting mental health among parents. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the nationwide home quarantine prevented special needs children from not only accessing normal school education, but also rehabilitation training, personalized intervention, and treatments [37]. This may lead to behavioral regression and extensive problems in special needs children. In this study, the three groups of special needs children had regulatory problems (such as an unwillingness to wear masks and unwillingness to wash hands) and externalized problems (such as asking to go out and mood swings). Combined with previous studies, special needs children’s behavioral problems are always closely associated with parenting stress, and jointly predict the mental health among parents of special needs children. Finally, the psychological demand of parents also predicts mental health among all parents. On the one hand, most parents were similar to the general public, in that they would frequently confirm information about the pandemic and hoard more supplies (such as masks) [38]. Some studies have shown that such behaviors are normal, although it could also lead to the emergence of a poorer general mental health condition of parents of special needs children [1]. On the other hand, parents of special needs children need to continually seek out special treatment, medical equipment, and other services about how to deal with child’s behavior, which would increase their psychological burden. The pandemic would prevent parents from seeking solutions to deal with the behavioral problems among special needs children. 4.2. The Differences Between the Three Groups of Parents of Special Needs ChildrenPrevious studies have shown that the behavioral problems of special needs children are determined by the type and degree of the child’s disorder. Among the behavioral problems of autism disorders, the core issues include communication impairments and interference with restrictive behaviors [17]. In this study, we reported six behavioral problems in children, such as unwillingness to wear masks, unwillingness to wash hands, asking to go out, sleep problems, eating problems, and mood swings. These may be important manifestations of restrictive behaviors in children with autism during the COVID-19 pandemic. In normal times, children with autism may also experience tantrums, impatience, and anxiety because they cannot go outside or are not used to obeying the new rules (such as wearing a mask). However, at the same time, children with autism spectrum disorder are not good at communicating with parents and solving problems independently [39]. Consequently, parents have to exert more time and resources, which may increase more parenting stress. From this perspective, children’s behavioral problems are closely related to parenting pressure, and jointly predict mental health among parents. Furthermore, behavioral problems in children with autism are also associated with parent–child dysfunctional interactions among parents. Studies have shown that there is a two-way connection between parent–child relationships and behavioral problems in children [40]. This means that children’s behavioral problems could predict the tendency or change in the emotional quality of parent–child relationships. In other words, parents have to work harder during these parent–child interactions [41]. When repeated and restrictive behavioral problems are difficult to solve, parents tend to be more directive and control by employing verbal or corporal punishments, which decrease closeness and increase parent–child dysfunction [42]. Over time, this not only strengthens behavioral problems in children, but also results in increased mental health problems of parents.Among parents of children with an intellectual disability, behavioral problems were not only related to parenting distress, but also to difficult children. Compared with the restrictive behaviors of children with autism, children with an intellectual disability are mainly impaired in intellectual functioning and have poor performance in evidencing of impaired adaptive functioning, such as conceptual, social communication, and practical self-care domains [43]. Such children need more sustained, long-term, and repeated training, which could gradually improve their daily behavior. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, policies not only interrupted children from receiving rehabilitation treatment, but also increased their externalized problems in the absence of social activities, increased loneliness, and insufficient information [4]. Furthermore, frequent regulatory problems (such as sleep problems) are also common behavioral problems in children with intellectual disabilities, which usually affect parents’ mental health [44]. Therefore, it is reasonable that the difficulty of parenting and the distress of parenting were used to predict mental health among parents of children with an intellectual disability.In addition, parents of children with intellectual disabilities were good at seeking family support. It is interesting to note that family support was only significantly associated with mental health among parents of children with an intellectual disability, rather than the other types of parents. In China, the mode of caring for intellectual disabilities children still relies heavily on families [45]. The model is changing, however, and social support systems are gradually being constructed [19,20]. Based on this, the symptoms of special needs children are easily noticed by their parents, who can gather family strength and help children access special treatment and equipment. Family support becomes a protective factor for parents [19,20,46]. However, some studies have showed that parents of children with autism receive less family support, which may result in increased parenting distress, anxiety, depression, and poor mental health among parents [47]. The relationship between social support and mental health in the other types of parents is complex, and requires additional research.Among parents of children with a visual impairment, we found that neither parenting stress nor social support was significant; however children’s behavioral problems were still significant. Compared to other special needs children, children with a visual or hearing impairment were likely to have fewer behavioral problems. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, children with a visual or hearing impairment also displayed the six behavioral problems as mentioned above. Moreover, owing to their visual or hearing impairment, these children lag behind typically developing children in speaking, writing, attention, and executive functions [48]. Spoken language and writing skills play important roles in communication; visual attention, executive function, etc., are conducive to planning, problem solving, and the suppression of behavioral problems [49,50]. Therefore, children with a visual or hearing impairment have more behavioral problems, which would increase the psychological demand of parents compared to typically developing children. Overall, the mental health among such parents tended to be consistent with parents of typically developing children.4.3. Implications This study has two implications for the parents of special needs children. On the one hand, the results showed that 27% of parents had poor mental health during the pandemic. This suggests that we need to pay more attention to the mental health of parents of special needs children, especially parents of children with autism or intellectual disabilities. On the other hand, for all groups of parents, family support was critical to parents’ mental health; however, the parents of children with autism are receiving insufficient family support. This should be addressed to improve parents’ mental health.4.4. LimitationsThere are some limitations that should be considered when interpreting this study’s findings. Firstly, we examined three types of disabilities; thus, the results cannot be generalized to parents of other special needs children. Secondly, all of the outcomes were self-reported, which might lead to recall bias. However, using self-reported scales to measure mental health is common because of its convenience. To enhance the internal validity of the results, future research may use multiple measurement modalities for each variable. Thirdly, because an online questionnaire was used in the study, the computer literacy of respondents might have affected how they responded to the questionnaire. Additionally, we controlled neuroticism to better understand the mental health of parents during the pandemic. To increase the validity of the results, other variables can be added in future studies. Finally, because the data collection took place during the pandemic, without further data collection, we cannot know the long-term impact of discrimination amid the pandemic on the respondents’ psychological distress. Future studies can utilize random sampling strategies with multiple data collection in order to study the impact of discrimination over time.5. ConclusionsIn summary, some parents of special needs children had mental health problems during the pandemic. There were significant differences in the mental health of parents depending on the child’s disability. Overall, the behavioral problems of children and the psychological demands of parents were common factors predicting the mental health of all parents. Parent–child dysfunctional interactions and parenting distress were associated with parents of children with autism spectrum disorder. Family support, difficult child, and parenting distress were associated with parents of children with an intellectual disability. It is therefore necessary to provide more social and family support to reduce pressure on parents.AcknowledgmentsWe sincerely thank all the respondents for participating in this study.Author ContributionsThe study was designed by J.R. and S.-Q.C.

The prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs) of intellectual disability among Chinese children and adolescents were compared with the global average by gender, age group, and severity of disability in 2019. Joinpoint regression model was used to analyze the trends in the prevalence and YLDs of intellectual disability among Chinese children and adolescents from 1990 to 2019.\nsectitleResults\nThe prevalence and YLDs of intellectual disability among Chinese children and adolescents in 2019 were 1 522.65 per 100 000 (95%emUIem: 1 228.62 per 100 000-1 817.55 per 100 000) and 109.81 per 100 000 (95%emUIem: 72.15 per 100 000-158.09 per 100 000), respectively, which were lower than the global average. The prevalence and YLDs of severe intellectual disability in China were slightly higher than the global average. The average annual percent changes in the prevalence and YLDs of intellectual disability among Chinese children and adolescents were -0.23% (95%emCIem: -0.26%--0.21%, emPem<0.001) and 0.74% (95%emCIem: 0.66%-0.81%, emPem<0.001) from 1990 to 2019, respectively. The prevalence and YLDs of severe intellectual disability showed continuously increasing trends over the past 30 years.\nsectitleConclusions\nThe disease burden of intellectual disability among Chinese children and adolescents was lower than the global average in 2019, but severe intellectual disability was higher than the global average. The prevalence of intellectual disability among Chinese children and adolescents showed an overall decrease, while YLDs showed an increasing trend from 1990 to 2019.\n\n\nkwd智力残疾kwd  kwd患病率kwd

207人患有智力残疾，智力残疾已成为重大的公共卫生问题。中国智力残疾问题同样不容小视。2006年第二次全国残疾人抽样调查结果显示，中国智力残疾患病率为7.5‰，占全部调查残疾的11.9%。本研究基于最新的全球疾病负担（Global Burden of Disease，GBD）研究数据，分析中国0~19岁儿童青少年智力残疾流行现状及其1990-2019年疾病负担的长期变化趋势。\nsec id=\\\"s2\\\"title资料与方法\n1. 数据来源：来源于GBD研究。GBD研究是世界范围内影响力最大的疾病负担研究，该数据库涵盖了204个国家和地区1990年以来369种疾病和伤害、87种危险因素造成的疾病负担，并可进行不同人群、不同年龄组的长期比较。GBD研究收集了WHO数据库、各国CDC、卫生统计局、公安和医院信息系统、人口普查、人群专项病例调查等多种来源的数据，并进行统一编码整理，然后采用标准化工具建模分析，按性别、年龄、地区和年份生成患病率、伤残损失健康生命年（years lived with disability，YLDs）等疾病负担指标的估计值，并提供95%不确定区间（uncertainty interval，emUIem）。具体的数据整理及建模分析方法见文献［xref ref-type=\\\"bibr\\\" rid=\\\"#R7\\\" id=\\\"R7B\\\"7xref］。GBD数据库中的中国数据主要来源于全国人口普查、人口调查、疾病监测点系统和死因登记报告信息系统，智力残疾调查数据来源于对公开发表文献的系统综述。本研究主要使用GBD数据库中1990- 2019年全球及中国0~19岁儿童青少年智力残疾患病率及YLDs数据。2. 分析指标：GBD研究中的智力残疾为发育性智力残疾。参照美国智力与发展障碍协会（American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities，AAIDD）标准，GBD研究中将智力残疾定义为发生在18岁之前的智力明显低于同龄儿童平均水平的状态，并且依据智商（intelligence quotient，IQ）测试得分将智力残疾分为5个等级：临界性智力残疾（IQ为70~85）、轻度智力残疾（IQ为50~69）、中度智力残疾（IQ为35~49）、重度智力残疾（IQ为20~34）、极重度智力残疾（IQ为0~19）。将0~19岁儿童青少年分为4个年龄组：0~、5~、10~、15~19岁。GBD研究使用贝叶斯元回归工具DisMod-MR 2.1估计智力残疾患病率。使用患病率乘以相应的残疾权重计算智力残疾的YLDs。3. 统计学分析：使用折线图展示1990-2019年全球及中国儿童青少年智力残疾患病率及YLDs的变化趋势。分性别、年龄、残疾严重程度比较2019年全球与中国儿童青少年智力残疾患病率及YLDs分布情况，并展示其95%emUIem。使用Joinpoint回归模型分析1990-2019年中国儿童青少年智力残疾患病率及YLDs的长期变化趋势。Joinpoint回归模型是时间趋势分析的一种方法，其优势在于根据疾病分布的时间特征建立分段回归，从而更详细地评价整体范围内不同时间区间疾病特异性的变化趋势。选择Joinpoint回归模型中的对数线性模型，以智力残疾患病率（10万）或YLDs（人年10万）为因变量，年份为自变量，采用Monte Carlo置换检验分析有统计学意义的连接点个数，此时的模型即筛选出的最优拟合模型。最优模型中连接点的位置即患病率长期变化趋势中的转折点。Joinpoint回归模型的主要结果指标是年度变化百分比（annual percent change，APC）和平均年度变化百分比（average annual percent change，AAPC）及其95%emCIem。APC即在各分段函数上因变量平均每年变化的百分比，反映各时间区间指标的变化趋势。AAPC则是因变量在全局的平均变化趋势。上述分析使用美国国立癌症研究所肿瘤控制与人口科学部开发的Joinpoint 4.8.0软件完成。\nsec id=\\\"s3\\\"title结果\n1. 2019年全球及中国智力残疾患病率分布特征：1990-2019年全球及中国儿童青少年智力残疾患病率整体均呈现下降趋势。2019年中国儿童青少年智力残疾患病率为1 522.6510万（95%emUIem：1 228.6210万~1 817.5510万），低于全球平均水平（3 069.0510万，95%emUIem：2 345.2510万~3
