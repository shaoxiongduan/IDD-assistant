        "text": "UNPRPD Situational Analysis in DRC 1 SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE RIGHTS OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES IN \nCHINA COUNTRY REPORT September 2023 Disclaimer The data and information presented in the report are based on the situational analyses conducted at the country level. Methodology for data collection included a desk review of relevant literature, key informant interviews and focus groups, and consultative workshops with key stakeholders. The UNPRPD has not edited the report or verified the findings for accuracy. This report does not necessarily reflect the position of the UNPRPD MPTF. Table of Contents \nAcronyms and Abbreviations \nExecutive Summary 2023 marks the 15 th year since China has ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2008. The landscape of disability inclusion in China has been undergoing deep transformation. This Situational Analysis provides an overview of the five preconditions for disability inclusion, as defined by the United Nations Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNPRPD) — equality and non-discrimination, inclusive service delivery, accessibility, CRPD compliant budgeting, and accountability and governance; and three cross-cutting issues including participation, inequalities, and gender. For each area of inquiry, the analysis follows the research questions provided by the UNPRPD, in identifying the gaps and opportunities to inform future development programs. The analysis is primarily based on secondary literature review, supplemented with consultations, carried out between March 2023 and June 2023. \nEquality and Non-Discrimination: China has more than 80 laws and 50 administrative regulations directly related to the interests of persons with disabilities, and regularly updated its national strategy for disability since 1991. Translating these commitments into better inclusion requires efforts to better align disabilityrelated policies and laws with the social model of disability, meaningfully engage OPDs independent from the state in decision making, and fully implement accessibility, reasonable accommodations, and antidiscrimination provisions. Culturally, the charity or medical model of disability remains dominant in public attitudes. \nAccessibility: China has issued more than 450 regulations, rules and normative documents on accessibility implementation and management. In recent years, campaigns are carried out to improve access to information. A further welcoming development is the new Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, passed on June 28, 2023. The effects of these policies depend on strong enforcement, sufficient remedies, and the meaningful engagement of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessibility tools and rules, with considerations of diverse needs among marginalized communities, such as deaf people/persons with hearing impairments, persons with intellectual disabilities, and persons with psychosocial disabilities. \nInclusive Service Delivery: Among 85 million officially estimated persons with disabilities, 38 million (44.7%) hold a disability certificate as of 2021. The task for service provision is daunting given the huge and diverse demands, and China has reached impressive coverage of services, especially in social protection and rehabilitation. To better align with the CRPD, the next step is to shift the focus from welfare provision to social inclusion, from special needs to inclusive services. This would require better rights awareness, accessibility, and reasonable accommodations in mainstream services, such as health, education, and employment; stronger support for caregiving instead of demanding family responsibilities; and more equitable allocation of resources for marginalized communities, such as persons with disabilities in rural areas, persons with severe or multiple disabilities, women with disabilities, and persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: According to the Ministry of Finance, in 2021, the national public budget expenditure on disability affairs was CNY 70.6 billion, roughly 0.287% of the total national general public budget expenditure. Majority of the disability budget (43.3%) was spent on living and care subsidies. Inclusive services such as inclusive education and employment, as championed by the CRPD, need stronger financial support. \nAccountability and governance: The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recommends an independent mechanism appointed to monitor the implementation of the CRPD. The CDPF regularly collects data from disability certificate holders and publishes annual updates in its key mandates, yet the data is not specifically aligned with the definition of disability or priority areas of the CRPD or SDGs. Data disaggregated by disability in mainstream statistical efforts need enhancement. Cross-cutting issues: The CDPF and its networks, ministries, OPDs, parent groups, CSOs, development partners, academia, and private sector form a vibrant sector working on the issue of disability in China. The challenge is to strengthen meaningful coordination within the government, and between OPDs and different stakeholders, especially when the social model of disability is not yet the consensus, resulting in scattered resources devoted to divergent, sometimes opposing, directions. Women with disabilities account for 49.33% of the total population with disabilities. Women face continued barriers in equal opportunities to education and employment, sexual and reproductive health, and marriage and social life. Further, voices of persons with disabilities and their representative groups, remain marginalized in the decision making, policy making, and humanitarian and development programming about disability. Among them, persons with disabilities in rural areas, persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities, and women with disabilities, are most disadvantaged. \nThis Situational Analysis reaffirms the importance of close partnerships between stakeholders, and the leadership of OPDs in making decisions about disability towards inclusion. Key recommendations of the report include: building meaningful mechanisms to enhance OPD participation that combines OPDs ’ expertise and other stakeholders ’ access to policy making; strengthening partnerships with specific government departments beyond its disabled persons ’ federations (DPFs) 1 , especially at local levels; and leveraging ongoing policy windows in accessibility, employment, and health. Background \nPurpose of analysis The UN Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (PRPD) is dedicated to the implementation of the CRPD, by bringing together different UN entities, governments, persons with disabilities and civil society for the purpose of joint programming and partnerships. To better support countries, the PRPD believes it is necessary to understand what the main bottlenecks and priorities are in each country in relation to the fulfilment of the CRPD. This Situational Analysis was developed as a requirement of the inception phase of the fourth call for proposals of the UNPRPD Multi-Partner Trust Fund (UNPRPD MPTF). Key objectives of the 4 th call include advancing CRPD implementation at country level by focusing on the preconditions for disability inclusion across sectors, and improving the implementation of disability inclusive SDGs at the country level. The main goal of the situational analysis is to inform the design of future cross-sector PRPD programs in China, with the report serving as a baseline. The analysis also aims to build working relationships between UN entities, government, OPDs, other civil society organizations, private sector and academia, as a basis for future co-design of programs; to strengthen the capacity of above stakeholders to include and address the rights of persons with disabilities more effectively; and to inspire disability inclusion adjustments in ongoing UN programs and processes. Introduction to disability in China Officially, China is home to 85 million persons with disabilities, roughly 6% of the total population. The most recent national survey on disability (2006) found that 17.8% of households in China had family members with disabilities. 75.04% of persons with disabilities resided in rural areas, 53.24% were above 60 years old, and 51.55% were men. 2 China ’s Law on the Protection of Disabled Persons (LPPD) defines a person with disabilities as “ one who has abnormalities of loss of a certain organ or function, psychologically or physiologically, or in anatomical structure and has lost wholly or in part the ability to perform an activity in the way considered normal. ” Based on this definition, six categories of disability are certified, including visual disabilities, hearing disabilities, physical disabilities, speech disabilities, intellectual disabilities, and psychiatric disabilities, with four grades under each category. By 2021, 38 million persons with disabilities held a disability certificate, among whom 22 million were men, and 30.1 million were registered as rural residents. 3 Among the disability certificate holders, 18.7% were illiterate, 40.3% received primary education, and 30.3% went to middle school. 4 \nThe China Disabled Persons Federation (CDPF), a semi-governmental mass organization with vice-ministry level status, was founded in 1988, marking significant national commitment to disability issues. 5 The CDPF ’s mission is to “ represent, serve, and manage ” persons with disabilities across China. 6 By 2018, a 4中国残疾人联合会. (2021).已办残疾证残疾人受教育程度. \ntotal of 42,000 disabled persons ’ federations (DPFs) had been set up at all administrative levels, 7 with about 90,000 full-time workers and 400,000 part-time staff members. 8 Shortly after the establishment of the CDPF, the LPPD, China first basic law for the rights protection of persons with disabilities was promulgated in 1990. Among the first countries to sign the CRPD, China ratified the CRPD in 2008. Under Article 35 of the CRPD, China has completed its first periodic report in 2012, and second and third combined in 2018. The latest review sessions of the State party reports by the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities concluded in 2022. 9 Approach \nGuiding principles Taking a rights-based approach rooted in the CRPD, this report follows the UNPRPD ’s framework of five preconditions for disability inclusion, namely, equality and non-discrimination, inclusive service delivery, accessibility, CRPD compliant budgeting, and accountability and governance; and three cross-cutting issues including participation, inequalities, and gender. \nThe research team follows the principle “ nothing about us without us ” in the design, implementation, and consultations of the situational analysis, ensuring the direct involvement of national and local organizations of persons with disabilities (OPDs), unofficial self-help groups of persons with disabilities, as well as individuals with disabilities. The core research team consists of members of a national OPD and an individual consultant in close coordination with the UNPRPD Taskforce in China, comprised of UNESCO, ILO, UNFPA, UN Women, and WHO. \nDespite time constraints, the research team strived to leverage the analysis as an opportunity to enhance relationships with and among stakeholders, bringing together government stakeholders, UNCT, and OPD leaders since the work plan design phase. Drafts of the report were sent to the UNCT, key government stakeholders, and OPDs for review, to ensure they are informed and involved in the analysis process. Methodology This report followed the research questions listed in the “ UN PRPD guidance for conducting a situational country analysis of the rights of persons with disabilities. ” The analysis took place from March 2023 to June 2023. Due to the condensed timeframe of the analysis and the richness of existing literature, the analysis is primarily based on desk review of secondary literature and data, supplemented with key informant interviews, focus group discussions, an OPD preparatory workshop, and a multi-stakeholder consultation. \nFor desk research, the analysis draws comprehensively from existing literature on the preconditions of inclusion in China, ranging from the CRPD reviews, issue-based UN publications, government documents, official database and publications of the CDPF, articles published by OPDs, media reports, as well as Chinese and English language academic research. \nConsultations for the analysis focused on questions under-addressed by existing literature. Depending on stakeholders ’ accessibility preferences and availability, a mixture of consultation methods were adopted. The research team consulted in total 70 informants through in-person/online interviews, email questionnaires, focus group discussions, meetings, and soliciting written feedback and evidence. Email questionnaires and interviews were conducted with 33 OPDs, among which 42% of are unregistered grassroots groups, located in 18 different cities, working on promoting the rights of persons with physical, visual, intellectual, psychosocial, hearing, or multiple impairments, people with rare diseases, gender, and cross-disability issues. The team also interviewed and/or organized focus group discussions with 4 civil society organizations, and 5 government institutions, including the Education and Employment Department, Rights Protection Department, and Organizational and Liaison Department of the China Disabled Persons ’ Federation. Further, the research team reached out to 22 experts with domain-specific questions through written or online interviews, including scholars, lawyers, and UN agencies, among whom 6 are persons with disabilities. The draft report went through comprehensive reviews by 3 external experts, representing the perspectives of OPDs, policy makers, and development partners, with specializations in law, education, and OPD development. List of consulted stakeholders is not provided for protection of anonymity. \nIn addition, the report incorporated data generated at four workshops. 30 stakeholders offered their perspectives in the induction trainings on 15-18 November 2022, and 8-9 December 2022. 34 OPD representatives from 28 organizations joined the OPD preparatory workshop on 8 May 2023, among whom 11 are persons with disabilities. On 9 May 2023, 74 stakeholders from 61 organizations attended the multi-stakeholder workshop, 19 of whom are persons with disabilities, representing OPDs, government, CSOs, academia, private sector, and development partners. Scope and limitations The Situational Analysis is a combination of consolidating existing data and consulting diverse opinions. It is therefore not an original research based on primary sources or raw data collection. The Situational Analysis is designed to inform future program design on disability inclusion under the framework of UNPRPD, not an expert opinion by the United Nations. \nThe analysis has revealed significant gaps in data availability, which means the data currently available is insufficient to answer the full range of analytical questions and topics covered in the UNPRPD framework. Some questions are insufficiently addressed due to the complexity and scale of the issue, unavailability of reliable data, or potential risks for stakeholders. A few questions are listed as suggestions for more comprehensive research in the future. \nAmong existing data, consistency in the definition of disability is not guaranteed. Government data tend to focus on registered organizations, and disability certificate holders which follows an impairment-based, biomedical definition of disability. Other studies may use informal channels to reach persons with disabilities and unregistered groups. \nIn light of the limited scope of the report, the analysis does not include all the information available for each focus area. It prioritizes addressing the questions listed in the UNPRPD Situational Analysis Guideline and identifying gaps and opportunities for future collaboration among multiple stakeholders. Conducted between March and June 2023, the analysis may not reflect the latest developments of this fast-changing field. \nThe majority of OPDs consulted for the report are urban, registered organizations, representing the interests of people with physical or visual impairments, cross disabilities, or parent groups of people with intellectual disabilities, including organizations led by women with disabilities; but less so for deaf organizations, self-advocates with intellectual disabilities or psychosocial disabilities. Further, voices of more marginalized persons with disabilities, such as those living in rural areas, or with multiple/severe disabilities, are largely reflected through secondary literature and data. Like other studies, those who were able to respond to our consultation are tip of the iceberg that are already active and expressive, but the vast majority of the most marginalized communities remain difficult to reach and their voices remain unheard. Findings \n1. Stakeholder and coordination analysis \n1.1 Government Lead ministries in ensuring the rights of persons with disabilities include the Ministry of Civil Affairs, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and the National Health Commission, which, together with the China Disabled Persons ’ Federation, form the core of the State Council Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work. Other important government stakeholders include National Bureau of Statistics, the Supreme People ’s Court, and the Supreme People ’s Procuratorate. As with SDGs, in 2016, China established an inter-ministerial coordination mechanism involving 45 government departments for SDG implementation, assigning the 17 goals and 169 targets to different departments according to their administrative responsibilities. 10 \nThe China Disabled Persons ’ Federation (CDPF) functions as the de facto whole-of-government disability focal point. It is a semi-governmental umbrella mass organization funded by the Chinese government to represent, serve, and supervise disability related affairs. Established in 1988, it now has a nationwide network of local branches across China, with about 90,000 full-time workers and 400,000 part-time staff members. 11 By 2018, a total of 42,000 disabled persons ’ federations (DPFs) had been set up across the nation. 12 \nThe Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work at all levels consist of ministry-specific disability focal points within government. At the State Council level, it is formed by focal points from 34 ministries, departments and organizations to coordinate the formulation and implementation of policies and programs in relation to persons with disabilities and address major disability-related issues. 13 The Committee is also responsible for coordinating major United Nations activities regarding disability affairs in China, including promoting the implementation of the CRPD. 14 The Committee ’s Secretariat is held by the CDPF ’s General Office. 15 At the local levels, the working committees mirror the same structure, usually chaired by the deputy head of the same level government, with focal points from various departments. 16 \nOfficial Associations: Under the supervision of the CDPF, there are five specialized national associations representing the interests of people with various types of disabilities: the China Association of the Blind, the China Association of the Deaf, the China Association of Persons with Physical Disabilities, the China Association of Persons with Intellectual Disability and their Relatives, the China Association of Persons with Psychiatric Disability and their Relatives. The five associations and its local branches operate as internal parts of the CDPF and its branches. 17 By 2018, there were a total of 16,000 branches of these 13 Ibid. \nassociations at provincial, municipal, and county levels. 18 In recent years, reform efforts have been made to register special associations as separate legal entities from the DPFs to enhance the professionalization of the associations. 19 Other state-affiliated mass organizations also play a role in domain-specific disability issues, such as All China Women ’s Federation, China Internet Society, and China Family Planning Association. 1.2 Disability Movement (OPDs) Based on the UNPRPD guidance, this report defines organizations of persons with disabilities (OPDs) as follows: “ Organizations of persons with disabilities are led, directed and governed by persons with disabilities. A clear majority of their membership should be recruited among persons with disabilities themselves. ” 20 According to this definition, organizations “ that work on disability inclusion are considered organizations ‘ for ’ persons with disabilities ” and do not count as OPDs. \nThe actual number of OPDs in China is unavailable and should be addressed by future research. Current estimations range from roughly 150 OPDs across China, 21 to only a handful of OPDs with continuous programs and staff, according to OPD informants consulted. Representative OPDs include, but are not limited to: 22 \nCross-disability OPDs: Cross-disability OPDs are among the most active at the national level. They pursue a diverse range of advocacy and service goals, including independent living, awareness raising of the CRPD, diverse employment (e.g. One Plus One Disability Group); public education on disability and gender equality (e.g. Beijing Enable Sister Center); inclusive education, and accessibility (e.g. Minority Voices). \nImpairment-based OPDs: In addition to cross-disability OPDs, many organizations serving communities of people with specific kinds of impairments are also active. These include organizations by and for people with physical impairments (e.g. Beijing New Start Foundation), deaf and/or people with hearing impairments (e.g. ProSigner, Know Deaf), people with visual impairments (e.g. Golden Cane 23 ), people with rare diseases (e.g. Illness Challenge Foundation), people with cerebral palsy (e.g. Angel House), and people on the autism spectrum (e.g. Mutual Support for Asperger's). \nOPDs in China tend to concentrate in urban areas, leaving a significant gap in smaller cities and rural areas. Many OPDs take the form of unregistered, online virtual groups, or small self-help groups, and very few have more than five full-time staff. Among existing OPDs, persons with intellectual disabilities, people with psychosocial disabilities, elderly people with disabilities, persons with disabilities living in rural areas, people with multiple impairments, and LGBTI persons with disabilities are underrepresented. For persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities, self-advocacy groups are still rare. Most of their representative groups are led by parents. 1.3 Parent Organizations It is debatable whether parent groups count as OPDs. In China, many parent groups self-identify as OPDs. Unlike other CSOs, they face similar barriers as OPDs, and are currently the main advocates for persons with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities. One Foundation, through their parent support programs, estimated that there were 162 parent organizations across China, mostly concentrated in capitals and first-tier cities. 24 In 2014, 17 parent groups and organizations across China formed a voluntary national network called Inclusion China, and by 2017 the network expanded to 69 members. 25 Another major network, Shenzhen Autism Society, for instance, has 116 member organizations as of 2023. 26 Total account of parent groups in China needs further research. 1.4 Service providing organisations (CSOs and INGOs) Government-procured service providers: Across China, many registered CSOs provide medical or vocational rehabilitation, day care, social work, assistive technology, and other services for persons with disabilities in local communities. As of June 2020, China had more than 7,800 officially registered social organizations that provides service and support in the disability field. 27 OPD informants of this report note that most of these CSOs for persons with disabilities do not have staff with disabilities. \nPhilanthropic Foundations: According to a recent OPD report, 2,363 philanthropic foundations had disability-related components in their programs, 27.59% of the total number of foundations in China. Between 2016 and 2020, funding for disability programs in disability-related foundations increased from CNY 5.58 billion to CNY 11.5 billion. Most of these foundations concentrate in East and Southwest China, with a focus on persons with physical disabilities, prioritizing rehabilitation and assistive technology. 28 International NGOs (INGOs): INGOs used to play an active role in supporting disability programs in China, providing funding, capacity building, and technical assistance for domestic CSOs/OPDs. The 2016 Law on Administration of Activities of Overseas Nongovernmental Organisations significantly increased the threshold and administrative costs for INGOs to operate in China. Currently, a handful INGOs are still working on disability issues in China, including Humanity & Inclusion (formerly known as Handicap International), which works on emergency relief, access to education and employment, sexual and reproductive health, gender-based violence against women and girls with disabilities, and social inclusion; Save the Children, which focuses on inclusive education for children with disabilities; as well as the Asia Foundation, Special Olympics East Asia, Kadoorie Charitable Foundation, Marie Stopes International, and the Ford Foundation. \nCSO/INGO engagement with OPDs varies according to their funding source, mandate, and awareness of the social model of disability. A handful of CSOs with exposure to the CRPD and INGOs tend to consciously engage OPDs, yet consultation shows that grassroots OPDs are largely disconnected from most CSOs in China. To date, there is no single civil society platform for SDG implementation, nor are OPDs actively engaged in policy platforms for SDG (see Section 8.1). 1.5 International Cooperation (UN Agencies, Donors) UNPRPD China Programme was implemented from 2014 to 2020. As a result of the Programme, the UN Country Team in China formed and institutionalized the UN Theme Group on Disability (UNTGD), a comprehensive, multi-stakeholder platform composing of over 100 key stakeholders for open dialogue and advocacy on the needs and rights of persons with disabilities in China. The UNTGD aims to consolidate the efforts and foster consultation and collaboration of its members including UN agencies and external disability stakeholders, in supporting the government in fulfilling its commitments to the CRPD and in achieving national goals on ensuring the equal rights of persons with disabilities. \nThe UNTGD is positioned to support the effective implementation of UN ’s collective commitments and actions in the new UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF), and to strengthen the UN ’s accountability towards disability inclusion in response to the Disability Inclusion Scorecard. The UNRCO and all UN agencies have respectively assigned a disability focal point as UNTGD member. The following agencies are especially engaging in advancing the rights of persons with disabilities with specific focuses relevant to their respective mandates: \n• UNESCO: inclusive education, information accessibility, promotion of disability inclusion through and in media and culture, media and information as well as digital literacy \n\n• UNICEF: inclusive education, accessible and child-friendly environment, social protection for children with disabilities, inclusive child welfare and protection services, public awareness raising and advocacy on disability inclusion. \n\n• UNFPA: strengthen universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) and GBV information and services, and advocate disability data generation \n\n• UNDP: access to justice for persons with disabilities \n\n• ILO: employment and decent work for persons with disabilities \n\n• UN Women: Research on gender gaps between men with disabilities and women with disabilities and support the advocacy of the rights of women and girls with disabilities \nNo other UN agencies ’ joint programs supporting legislative reforms, policy development or other relevant national programs that are important for persons with disabilities are available. The knowledge and understanding of UN agencies staff on disability inclusive programming have been gradually enhanced in recent years, especially among the staff members from the agencies that are closely involved in the capacity building activities and joint programmes and activities on disability inclusion. Key trainings include: a half-day meeting and discussion on disability equality for UN staff held on 1 August 2018, participated by 18 UN colleagues from 10 UN agencies; a Disability Equality Training workshop for UNCT held in 2019 to strengthen the UNCT ’s capacity to ensure a human rights-based approach to disability is reflected in their work at all times, participated by 16 representatives from six UN agencies; a knowledge sharing session at the regular meeting of the UN Communications Group in China on media communications for promoting disability equality in China held in 2021, participated by communication officers from 20 UN agencies; and the six-day Induction workshop held under the UNPRPD 4th Funding Call Inception Phase in November-December 2022, participated by six colleagues representing 5 UN agencies, including UNESCO, ILO, UNFPA, WHO, UN Women and FAO. \nThe situation and rights of persons with disabilities is incorporated into the Common Country Analysis, UNSDCF and Joint Work Plans in full consultation with the UNTGD. As a result, the UNSDCF 2021-2025 has integrated disability inclusion by setting the commitment to “ leaving no one behind ” as one of its guiding principles and explicitly identifying persons with disabilities as one o f the groups more at risk of being left behind in China. Persons with disability are particularly referenced in parts related to rehabilitation services, full social inclusion, development, and legitimate rights and interests. Besides, UNSDCF also specifically stipulates that the participation of CDPF in the review and implementation of the UNSDCF will be made at the level of the Results Groups. \nSpecifically, under the UNSDCF Strategic Priority 1 “ People and Prosperity: Achieving innovation-driven, coordinated and shared development ”, Outcome 2 reads, “ People ’s lives in China are improved further as headways is made in ensuring access to childcare, education, healthcare services, elderly care, housing, and social assistance, and more people in China, including left-behind groups, benefit from equitable and high quality public services and social protection systems as well as accelerated efforts to reduced gender inequality and other forms of social inequality throughout the life-course. ” \nThe UN makes an effort to engage persons with disabilities and their representative organizations closely across ongoing programs at country level. One attempt was to make the UN premises more accessible. An assessment on the accessibility of the physical environment and services of all UN premises in China has been completed with support of the Accessibility Development Institute of Tsinghua University in 2021, with detailed recommendations provided for improvement. \nUNTGD provides a platform for international development partners to engage with OPDs. Currently, a few bilateral and multilateral donors such as the European Commission and British Council still have programs on disability. However, consultations show that international cooperation is increasingly scrutinized by authorities, and OPDs and local stakeholders are cautious about such engagement. \n1.6 Other Key Stakeholders (Academic, Private sector): Academic institutions or think tanks play an important role in the sector, due to their access to policy making channels. However, not all academics are aligned with the CRPD. OPDs are concerned that some academic institutions regard disability as an object of research but do not meaningfully engage OPDs, displacing rather than amplifying the voices of persons with disabilities. \nPrivate sector is increasingly active in disability inclusion, due to shifting funding structure for OPDs/CSOs, domestic policy incentives for disability-inclusive employment and services, and global corporate cultural change towards Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), and corporate social responsibility (CSR). A few social enterprises have been active in engaging the private sector. However, balancing the interests of business clients and the disability community is a challenge, which needs to involve different stakeholders, including government, disability advocates, and businesses themselves. A missed opportunity identified by informants is the lack of engagement with OPDs, reinforcing the fragmentation of limited resources of the field. Further, most businesses still lack the awareness of the social model of disability, taking a charity-based or tokenistic approach. 1.7 Key Stakeholder Coordination Mechanisms In China, most OPDs are unregistered, virtual groups rather than registered organizations with a physical presence, reachable through informal networks of key individuals within disability community. Administratively, the threshold for registration as a social organization with the Ministry of Civil Affairs is high. According to a 2015 survey of 110 OPDs in China, only 58% of OPDs are legally registered with bureaus of civil affairs. 29 OPD informants point out that registered OPDs also face strict administrative requirements. Financially, many OPDs ’ funding sources were impacted by the Law on Administration of Activities of Overseas Nongovernmental Organisations, adopted in 2016, which significantly restricted domestic NGOs and individuals from obtaining funding from overseas NGOs. 30 Main funding sources available now are the government, the general public, and the private sector. These funders tend to prefer more traditional approaches to disability such as the charity or medical model, thus disadvantaging OPDs promoting the social model of disability. OPDs consulted for this report, mostly grassroots, lack experience working with INGOs, the UN, or academic partners. Key OPD informants observe that compared to other civil society groups, OPDs in China tend to rely on individual leaders and face more challenges in professional development, due to systemic exclusion of persons with disabilities in social participation, such as quality education. \nWithin China ’s national development frameworks and human rights monitoring and reporting, disability is represented as a special issue, rather than mainstreamed as a cross-cutting issue across sectors. China ’s national human rights monitoring and reporting such as human rights white papers refer to disability as one thematic issue among “ vulnerable groups ” such as women, children, ethnic minority, and elderly people. Consultation shows that the CDPF and its local networks dominate the current coordination mechanism to facilitate disability-related actions across different sectors and levels of the government. 1.8 Stakeholder Capacity Gaps Within the government, the current coordination mechanism guarantees financial and human resources on disability across different levels of the government through the CDPF networks. This bureaucratic division of labor, however, tend to pigeon-hole disability as CDPF ’s responsibility and lacks the support from mainstream ministries. Expert informants point out that as a “ semi-governmental, semi-civil ” organization, CDPF does not have the same administrative power as the ministries, making certain coordination with other ministries difficult. \nCoordination mechanisms between government and OPDs are inconsistent. Formal mechanisms for stateendorsed CSOs/OPDs to coordinate with the government do exist, such as the Disabled People ’s Representative Congress. For independent OPDs, however, coordination with the government is limited. OPDs that have successfully engaged the government tend to leverage informal channels such as joint programs with DPFs or the special associations, working with key individuals within the government, or submitting policy proposals through elected National People ’s Congress (NPC) and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) representatives. Nevertheless, most OPDs lack access to these mechanisms. In the limited scope of consultations for this report, informants note that formal mechanisms of OPDs participation tend to be symbolic, and the power imbalance makes meaningful dialogue difficult. Meanwhile, results of informal mechanisms are highly contingent. For more detail, see Section 7.1. \nOPD informants critique that the framing of “ capacity gap ” is misleading, when persons with disabilities do not have equal access to social capital and resources as the government or other CSOs, nor do OPDs have the power to meaningfully participate. A common capacity gap identified by rights holders (OPDs), duty bearers (government) and development partners is resource mobilization. Consultations show that the lack of overall resources dedicated to disability inclusion, and the diverse range of needs of persons with different impairments has created competitions rather than collaboration among OPDs and other stakeholders. A deeper gap identified in consultation is the low awareness of the social model of disability, rendering government, OPDs, and other stakeholders devoting scattered resources to different, sometimes opposing, directions. 2. Equality and non-discrimination \n2.1 Legislative and policy context China has ratified the CRPD in 2008, without ratifying its Optional Protocol. Under Article 35 of the CRPD, China completed its first periodic report in 2012, and second and third combined in 2018. Review of the latest report concluded in September 2022. On 5 February 2022, China ratified the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled. Other international human rights treaties that China ratified include Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), Convention against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), and International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD). 31 Reporting for CEDAW and CRC typically include references to persons with disabilities. Officially, China has more than 80 laws and 50 administrative regulations directly related to the interests of persons with disabilities. 32 The main legislation stipulating the rights of persons with disabilities in China is the Law on the Protection of Disabled Persons (LPPD), first enacted in 1990 and amended in 2008 in anticipation of the CRPD ratification. Legal experts point out that significant gaps still exist between the 2008 LPPD and the CRPD, including, but not limited to, the lack of provisions of reasonable accommodation, equal recognition before law, and full inclusion of women and children with disabilities, and the law ’s prioritization of prevention and rehabilitation of disability based on medical definitions of disability. 33 A crucial gap lies in the difference in definitions of disability between the LPPD and CRPD, leading to different approaches to addressing disability-related issues. The LPPD (2008) defines a person with disabilities as “ one who has abnormalities of loss of a certain organ or function, psychologically or physiologically, or in anatomical structure and has lost wholly or in part the ability to perform an activity in the way considered normal. ” 34 \nIn addition to the LPPD, major legislations include the 2017 Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities, the 2017 Regulations on the Education of Persons with Disabilities, the Regulations on the Employment of the Disabled, and the 2012 Regulations on the Construction of Barrier-free Environments, 35 and the 2012 Mental Health Law. China ’s first Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments solicited public comments for drafts in 2022 and 2023, and was passed on June 28, 2023, which presents a key policy window for accessibility advocacy. \nChina does not have a general anti-discrimination framework or legislation, 36 although disability related laws are “ against disability-based discrimination ” in principle. The current laws and policies do not have a clear definition of disability-based discrimination, making it difficult for judicial determination of discrimination. 37 The provision of reasonable accommodation is not yet included in all relevant laws and policies, and lacks clear guidance on implementation and effective remedies. 38 As a step forward, some local regulations began explicitly referencing reasonable accommodations. 39 Major progress was made in the national college entrance examination (gaokao) system. Since 2014, there has been policy development for students with disabilities to apply for reasonable accommodations to take gaokao. Statistics show that, in 2017, 5626 students with disabilities applied for reasonable accommodation for gaokao. Advocates call for expanding such progress to more areas such as exams for public servants, high school entrance exams, and judicial exams. 40 \nChina has regularly updated its national strategy for disability since 1991, in the form of five-year development plans. By far, the State Council has issued eight five-year development plans for persons with disabilities, incorporated into the overall five-year plans for national economic and social development. Government at local levels shall make corresponding implementation plans and incorporate the implementation into government work evaluation. Annual monitoring, mid-term evaluation, concluding evaluation, third-party evaluation, and social satisfaction rate survey of the implementation of the five-year plans, are also stipulated. 41 The latest plan, the 14 th Five-year Plan on the Protection and Development of Persons with Disabilities (2021-2025), focuses on livelihood and employment, social protection, and basic public services. It sets the framework and indicators for implementation, although it is not specifically aligned with the CRPD or SDG plans and programs. \nA key legal harmonization effort, according to UN ESCAP, is “ the revision by China in 2008 of its 1990 law on the protection of persons with disabilities in an effort to incorporate the concepts and principles of the Convention into the legislation. This included a prohibition of disability discrimination, although it did not include definitions of disability or reasonable accommodation championed by the CRPD and did not explicitly state that denial of reasonable accommodation is disability discrimination. Subsequent ongoing reform efforts in China have since led to revision of the laws and regulations relating to education, transport, accessibility to the built environment and the mental health law in an effort to align them with the Convention. ” 42 2.2 Barriers to Equity The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities observed systemic barriers to the inclusion of persons with disabilities in China, including that 43 : \n• disability-related policies and laws do not fully align with the social model of disability; \n\n• OPDs independent from the state are not meaningfully included in policy-making; \n\n• anti-discrimination and reasonable accommodations are not legally guaranteed or fully implemented; \n\n• there are limited mechanisms in preventing violence, trafficking, forced marriage, neglect, or abandonment of women and children with disabilities; \n\n• substitute decision-making regime persists to deny or restricts adults with disabilities in their legal capacity to act; \n\n• lack of procedural accommodation, accessible information, and inaccessible buildings impedes disabled persons ’ access to justice; \n\n• discriminatory provisions in the LPPD allow for coercive institutionalization and treatment of persons with psychosocial disabilities; \n\n• accessibility regulations and standards are insufficiently enforced; \n\n• the state pressures on and censors rights-based advocacy; \n\n• segregated special education remains the norm and mainstream schools lack support regarding inclusive education; \n\n• the right to freely choose occupations and access to just and favourable conditions of work is lacking; \n\n• and legal restrictions to disabled persons ’ political participation still persists. \nAmong these barriers, consultations for this report identified the social prejudice and discrimination against persons with disabilities as the most fundamental. Debates between the “ welfare ” approach and the “ rights ” approach to disability remain among policy and law makers. Specific barriers in domains such as accessibility, education, and employment will be addressed in detail in Section 3 and Section 4. 3. Accessibility \n3.1 Legislative and policy context By 2017, China has issued 451 regulations, rules and normative documents on accessibility implementation and management. 44 The main regulation on accessibility is the Regulations on the Construction of Barrier-free Environments (2012), which stipulate that the construction and modification of roads, public buildings, public transport facilities, residential buildings and residential areas shall comply with the construction standards for barrier-free facilities. China also incorporated barrier-free construction into its national development plans, such as the Implementation Programme for Construction of Barrier-Free Environments during the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (2016 –2020), and the National Plan on New Urbanization (2014 –2020). National accessibility standards (GB 50763-2012) have also been adopted. Comprehensive data about the application of the technical standards are unavailable and should be addressed by future research. Accessibility is not yet mainstreamed into public procurement, according to government informants consulted. \nIn recent years, more attention has been paid to the accessibility of information and communications. In 2020, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and CDPF issued the Guiding Opinions on Promoting Information Accessibility, focusing on removing barriers of the affordability, devices, and services of information for persons with disabilities. 45 On 5 February 2022, China ratified the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled. In 2021, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology launched a whole year Action Plan to modify the accessibility of internet applications for elderly people and persons with disabilities, mitigating “ digital divides. ” 46 The Action Plan explicitly listed 158 websites and applications targeted for modification, ranging from those of governments, news outlets, airlines and railways, social media, and e-commerce, to search engines, banks, travel agencies, health services. By 2022, over 800 government entities modified their web accessibility, 320 websites passed an accessibility audit, and nearly 100 applications added accessibility features such as large fonts, high contrast, and easy to read pages. 47 The provision of accessible services such as sign language interpretation are mentioned in the Rule on the Construction of Accessible Environment, Guiding Opinions on Strengthening the Construction of Broadcasting and Television Public Service System, and National Basic Public Service Standards. China has also issued its Second National Sign Language and Braille Standardization Action Plan (2021-2025), and the Promotion Plan for National Universal Sign Language. \nIn 2022, the draft Law on Construction of Barrier-Free Environments solicited public opinions. The second draft was released for public comments in April 2023. The legislation is widely recognized as a catalytic opportunity for raising the awareness of accessibility, and specifying the implementation measures at the local level. Expert informants involved in the legislative process praised the draft law for emphasizing accessibility at the planning stage, and legally recognizing the universal benefits of accessibility. Controversies remain about how strict the enforcement will be. OPDs are concerned about the lack of clarity on accountability and remedies, 48 the insufficient attention to the needs of persons with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities, 49 and the significant room for discretion for duty-bearers to not comply with the law, 50 making it a symbolic law with “ no teeth. ” \nFormal evaluation mechanisms are being established, such as the Evaluation System of the Elderlyoriented and Barrier-free Internet Services, 51 and Barrier-free Facility Evaluation Standards for Civic Constructions. 52 In some cities, persons with disabilities have participated in monitoring accessibility through citizen hotlines (e.g. 12345), and local-level “ barrier-free inspectors ” typically formed by local government, experts, and representatives of persons with disabilities. 53 Beijing recently released a comprehensive database (https://data.beijing.gov.cn/wzazt/) on the locations and conditions of accessible facilities in the city. 54 Consultations reveal that major international events (e.g. Olympic/Paralympic Games) and China ’s ageing population are key opportunities for promoting accessibility. 3.2 Key Gaps in Accessibility \nBuilt Environment Despite increased policy commitment and investment, barriers in built environment remain. Data on the budgeting and monitoring of accessibility are not consistently available. According to a 2017 national survey conducted by China Consumer Society and CDPF, the overall coverage of barrier-free facilities (including accessible exits and entrances, elevators, wheelchair accessible bathrooms, and sign language proficiency among staff) in Chinese cities was 40.6%, among which hospitals had the highest coverage (67.4%) and commercial areas were the lowest (31.2%). Among existing barrier-free facilities, many were unavailable, occupied, under-maintained, and poorly designed. Public satisfaction rate for accessibility was also low. The survey shows barriers including technical challenges in architectural modification, lack of government coordination, lack of business incentives, and discriminatory attitudes towards consumers with disabilities. 55 \nInformal monitoring by OPDs also exist. For instance, a survey of over 600 travelers with disabilities shows that the top five barriers that persons with disabilities face when traveling are lack of accessible facilities (61.7%), unavailability of information about accessibility (46.4%), inaccessible hotels and transportation (41.9%), lack of accessible services (27.2%), and negative attitudes by service providers (18.8%). 56 The lack of barrier-free facilities not only impedes equal participation of persons with disabilities in society but also poses threats to the personal safety of persons with disabilities, as revealed by two incidents caused by poor accessibility leading to the deaths of two activists with disabilities. 57 58 The gaps further widen in rural areas. 59 Information and communications Gaps continue to exist between the high demand for accessible information and the poor supply. First, as consultations for this report reveal, the accessibility of websites and applications remain fragmented and uneven. Some software developed “ accessible versions ” as alternative services provided for users with disabilities, but these versions are often inferior to and less updated than mainstream versions. Some applications become even less accessible after modification, because of the lack of participation of users with disabilities. Lacking systemic planning and coordination, iteration of applications can overwrite previous accessibility features. \nThe legislative system of information accessibility is incomplete, according to the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT). 60 Current laws and regulations lack coherence, clarity of responsibilities, and the power to enforce. Existing standards for accessibility are “ encouraged ” rather than mandatory. They are impractical, poorly implemented, and outdated. In addition, CAICT points out that internet applications typically fail to consider the needs of persons with disabilities at the design phase, making it difficult for modifications later on. 61 Accessible services The draft law on accessible environment included provisions on accessible services. Currently, basic social services in support of access to information, such as sign language interpretation, relay services, live captioning, alternative texts, audio description, and easy-to-read formats for public information, are still lacking. These problems were heightened during emergency communication during COVID-19. Deaf/hearing impaired informants note that most news reporting does not include captioning. Highquality sign language interpretation is rare. Advocates still cite an early survey published by CDPF in 1998, revealing that 78 –89% of deaf people understood less than 60% of the Chinese sign language signed on TV news channels. 62 According to the National Sign Language and Braille Research Center in 2014, only 63.1% of deaf students “ somewhat ” understood the sign language used by hearing teachers in deaf schools. 63 \nDeaf informants consulted highlight that the quantity and quality of sign language interpretation have significant gaps in China. They are concerned that, due to hearing-centric policies that prioritize speech therapy and hearing rehabilitation over sign language acquisition, children with hearing impairments experience various degrees of language deprivation, resulting in the systemic exclusions of deaf/hard of hearing people in education, work, and social life. Even in disability inclusion programs and events, deaf informants have experienced a lack of meaningful language accommodation and equal participation with hearing persons with disabilities. \n61 Ibid. OPDs consulted for the report identified the following key gaps in accessibility as the most urgent: low public awareness of accessibility, weak enforcement of laws and standards, and the lack of participation of persons with disabilities in designing, monitoring, and evaluating accessibility. Expert informants note that enforcement of accessibility policies requires strong inter-ministerial coordination, which DPFs lack sufficient authority for. Awareness of local government leadership and the support of more powerful ministries is crucial. OPDs are also calling for strengthening the digital literacy of persons with disabilities, which is positively correlated with income levels in China. 64 A CDPF joined study found that due to lack of internet access or devices, prohibition by parents, and insufficient skills to use accessibility features, the usage rate of internet among youth with disabilities (aged 10-18) is merely 68%, significantly lower than youth without disabilities (94.9%). 65 While digital tools are important means of production, there lacks systemic assessment of the digital literacy of persons with disabilities. 4. Inclusive Service Delivery \n4.1 Disability assessment and referral systems China ’s current disability determination system does not align with the CRPD ’s social model definition of disability, or the WHO classification system. The Classification and Grading Criteria for Disability (GB/T 26341-2010) provides national standards for six types of disability, namely visual impairment/blind, Hearing impairment/deaf, Physical disability, Speech disability, Intellectual disability, and Psychiatric disabilities, with four grades under each type. Legal determination of disability is conducted by designated medical institutions, and the recognition of disability comes in the form of a certificate issued by the CDPF, which is a prerequisite for applying for disability subsidies and functions as an identification to access a range of benefits and services. Early i dentification and intervention mechanisms for children aged 0-6 are promoted by the N ational Disability Prevention Action Plan (2021-2025) and the Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities (2017). In 2021, 278,695 children with disabilities received basic rehabilitation services nationwide. 66 Quality of the services, disaggregated by type of disability, location, and gender, needs further assessment. \nPredominantly based on biomedical criteria, the system does not account for the social and environmental factors that affect people ’s capacity to undertake activities of daily life and participation. The determination criteria also prioritize people who could not recover after receiving treatment for over a year, and does not account for temporary impairments. 67 \nThe DPFs regularly update and monitor data of certified persons with disabilities, as basis for service provision and policy making. Among 85 million officially estimated persons with disabilities, only 38 million (44.7%) hold a disability certificate as of 2021, and 57.8% of them are men. 68 The low rate of certificate holding is in part due to stigma, lack of information, inaccessibility of the determination system, and 68中国残疾人联合会. (2021). 3-2全国持证残疾人人口基础库主要数据. \nmismatch with the official criteria. 69 Persons with disabilities can make complaints through the government service hotlines or petitioning (xinfang) reception system/staff/office of local governments and DPFs. 4.2 Disability Support Services The 13 th Five-Year Plan to Promote Equal Provision of Basic Public Services dedicated a section on basic services for persons with disabilities, including social protection, nursing care, rehabilitation, education, vocational training and employment services, culture and sports, and accessible environment support. 70 The 14 th five-year plan on disability aims to increase the access, availability and diversity of support allowances and services. CDPF is the main coordinator of service provision for persons with disabilities. 71 Disability support services are mainly funded by the government, and delivered through direct service or government procurement of services from public institutions, registered social organizations including social workers, or private service providers. 72 According to the Disabled Persons Service Provider Management Measures (2018), CDPF and its branches are commissioned to supervise disability service providers. Local government departments shall make plans for service provision based on the population size, distribution, and service needs of persons with disabilities in their jurisdiction, and include service providers in the basic public service system. Service providers are required to conduct needs assessment and evaluation to design and update services, and provide accessible facilities. 73 Most public services are provided for disability certificate holders within local jurisdictions with low or no cost. Due to the variety and decentralization of services, the general number of service providers to persons with disabilities ratio is unknown. A key grassroots service coordination mechanism within the DPF system is the “ special commissioners on disability issues, ” who are typically persons with disabilities or their family members, responsible for home visits, needs assessment, local-level disability work planning, policy coordination, event organizing, and conflict resolution. 74 As of 2021, there are 57,208 commissioners at the county level, and 494,047 commissioners at village and community levels across China. 75 This means, roughly 15 community-level DPF staff are hired to support per 1000 disability certificate holders, and their numbers are unevenly distributed geographically. More full-time commissioners are concentrated in urban areas, and commissioners in rural areas often combine multiple roles of coordinating disability, civil affairs, women ’s issues in one person. 76 The commissioners are often overworked, under-equipped, and under-skilled. 77 Informants note that the commissioners do not usually work with independent OPDs. Rehabilitation Rehabilitation services are stipulated by the Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities (2017). Rehabilitation services are mainly delivered through the health system, DPF system, and the civil affairs system. Children aged 0-6 are prioritized, and offered full coverage of rehabilitation services. 78 As of 2017, 65.6% of persons with disabilities had access to rehabilitation services. 79 In 2021, 47.8% of those receiving rehabilitation services are persons with physical disabilities, and another 18.5% are people with psychiatric disabilities. 80 In recent years, progress has been made to expand rehabilitation from centralized medical rehabilitation to community-based rehabilitation by OPDs and self-help groups. 81 OPDs consulted call for more rehabilitation services aimed at community inclusion such as in educational or vocational settings. Assistive Technologies Public provision of assistive devices are delivered through CDPF ’s rehabilitation departments and the civil affairs system. In 2017, 2.4 million persons with disabilities received assistive devices, 82 including white canes, vision-assistive devices, wheelchairs, prosthetic limbs, hearing aids, and cochlear implants. Consultations show that gaps exist in obtaining affordable, accessible, usable, and customized assistive devices for persons with disabilities. Currently, most assistive devices are still delivered through the government ’s centralized planning, which resulted in the lack of customization, preference for products with lower bidding price over quality, and rigid restrictions for eligibility. 83 In recent years, cash subsidies for assistive technologies of the users ’ own choice are being piloted in places like Beijing, Liaoning, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. 84 Many user-friendly assistive technologies provided by private sector remain unaffordable for most persons with disabilities without subsides from the government. Care Services Officially, care services for persons with disabilities include home-based care, day care, and residential care services, targeting people with intellectual, psychosocial disabilities, and people with severe physical disabilities. 85 National standards were set in 2019. 86 Some care facilities offer “ assistive employment ” programs for both rehabilitation and employment purposes through low skill labor such as handicraft making. As of 2021, 608988 disability certificate holders are residing in 11,278 institutionalized care services nationwide, including boarding institutions, day care, and more comprehensive facilities. 87 Consultation shows that the care responsibility mostly falls on family members, especially women, with little alternative options, but some policies continue to encourage a family-centered care approach. \nFor mental health care, data on the proportion of government budget spent on institutionalized care versus community-based support are not available. 88 Although specific plan and timeline to transition to community-based support (as per the CRPD) is unknown, China is promoting community-based rehabilitation for persons with psychosocial disabilities, setting the goal to cover at least 80% of counties across the country by 2025. 89 4.3 Mainstream Services \nSocial protection China ’s social protection system for persons with disabilities include three main mechanisms: 1) welfare subsidies (fuli butie), such as living subsidies for disabled persons in hardships, and care subsidies for persons with severe disabilities; 2) social insurance subsidies (shehui baoxian butie), such as pension and medical insurance subsidies; and 3) special assistance (zhuanxiang jiuzhu), such as minimum living standard guarantee (dibao), and assistance for disaster, healthcare, education, and housing. 90 \nChina has reached wide coverage of social protection for persons with disabilities. For example, living allowances for poor people with disabilities and nursing subsidies for severely disabled persons now cover more than 24 million people. 10.67 million people with disabilities are included in the system of subsistence allowances. All poor persons with disabilities are covered by basic medical insurance and serious illness insurance, according to an official white paper. 91 \nBy 2021, China has declared success in lifting more than 7 million persons with disabilities out of absolute poverty. 92 Yet persons with disabilities remain economically marginalized. Experts estimate that 36% to 44% of certified persons with disabilities in China can be considered under “ relative poverty. ” 93 In 2019, over 30% of total disability certificate holders received living subsidies for disabled persons in hardships, and care subsidies for persons with severe disabilities. 94 Social protection remains an important source of income for persons with disabilities, making up 13.2% of total disabled persons ’ household income on average. 95 Households with the lowest income are most dependent on social protection, but their average income from social protection was merely CNY 2,631.30 per year, as of 2019. 96 Health \nGeneral healthcare China ’s mainstream health policies and strategies predominantly regards disability as a target for prevention and clinical rehabilitation. The Regulations on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation for Persons with Disabilities (2017), the 14 th Five-year Plan on disability, 97 and the National Disability Prevention Action Plan (2021-2025), 98 all define preventing disability as specific health targets. The Healthy China 2030 Plan re-emphasizes the rehabilitation and prevention of disabilities, with a provision on “ enhancing the accessibility of medical institutions, and improving medical services for people with disabilities. ” 99 Some hospitals do provide accessible volunteer services, especially for persons with hearing or visual impairments. Consultations for this report reveal that mainstream medical system remain largely inaccessible, or unaffordable for certain communities of persons with rare diseases, and adopts a strong medical model of disability that fails to connect the patients ’ medical needs with social services. \nAccess to general healthcare is uneven. A recent analysis based on data from the National Survey on Basic Public Service Delivery of Persons with Disabilities revealed high rate of unmet healthcare needs. 15.4% of persons with disabilities lacked regular medical care when ill, and 45.6% reported needing more targeted rehabilitation services than they had. Rural residents were 13-40% more likely to lack healthcare, which was in part the result of the unequal access to health facilities, social participation, and health professionals at the community level. Among the respondents, persons with multiple disabilities experienced the highest levels of overall unmet healthcare needs, and people with physical disabilities had more unmet needs in rehabilitation. 100 Further, among China ’s over five million children with disabilities, 63% did not receive adequate healthcare, due to poor information, shortage of services, and affordability. 101 General health data disaggregated by disability, such as evidence of inequalities in health faced by persons with disabilities (corresponds to the OHCHR CRPD-SDG indicators) are not available. \nSexual and Reproductive Health and Rights Women with disabilities face additional barriers in accessing healthcare, especially sexual and reproductive health (SRH). 102 Women and youth with disabilities face higher risks of sexual violence, forced abortion, contraception and sterilization, financial and other forms of control, 103 yet they have limited access to SRH information and services. 104 In a UNESCO China and Humanity & Inclusion study, less than 20% young persons with disabilities in both urban and rural areas reported having counselling, referral services, or free contraceptives in their schools or communities. 105 A study co-funded by the CDPF \n105 Ibid. \nand State Council Committee on Women and Children ’s Work revealed large gaps in disabled women ’s access to healthcare and rehabilitation services. For instance, in Heilongjiang province, merely 50.2% women with disabilities received prenatal check during their last childbirth, 20.4 percentage points lower than women in general. Women with disabilities in rural areas had an even lower prenatal checking rate of 36.2%, and were significantly less likely (46.7 percentage points less) than urban women with disabilities to receive in-hospital child delivery care, indicating sharp disparity between urban and rural service provision. 106 Women with disabilities in poor households also experience higher prevalence of SRH related diseases. 107 An 2015 study tested the SRH knowledge of 248 women with disabilities, and the correction rate was 45.14%. 108 In response, UNESCO, UNFPA, Marie Stopes International, and Youren Foundation have conducted comprehensive sexuality education for persons with disabilities. \nChina ’s 2015 Anti-Domestic Violence Law, the Healthy China 2030 Plan, the Outline for Women's Development in China (2021-2030), the Outline for Children ’s Development in China (2021-2030), and China CDC ’s “ Towards 2030: Achieving Equal Access to Reproductive Health — China Reproductive Health Strategic Framework, ” provide important policy momentum for the protection of SRH rights for persons with disabilities and provision of more inclusive SRH services. More than a health issue, SRH issues affect girls ’ attendance in schools, women ’s participation in the labor force, women ’s voice at home and communities, the safety and right to life of persons with disabilities. For this reason, expert informants argue that SRH presents an effective entry point for influencing the general healthcare system, and comprehensively addressing gender-based discrimination faced by women in education, work, and social participation. Education The right to education for persons with disabilities is stipulated by China ’s Constitution, the LPPD, the Law on Compulsory Education, and the Regulations on the Education of Persons with Disabilities. The Ministry of Education (MOE) regulate and oversee all schools providing education for persons with disabilities, in coordination with local health departments, civil affairs departments, and the DPFs. 109 According to the MOE, the enrolment rate in compulsory education among children with disabilities has reached over 95%. 110 The Action Plan for Special Education Development (2021-2025), issued in 2022 by the MOE, planned to expand the coverage of compulsory education for children with disabilities to 97% by 2025. 111 China has taken steps towards a more inclusive education approach. In 2017, China revised the Regulations on the Education of Persons with Disabilities, 112 more firmly stating the principle of inclusive education and anti-discrimination than the 1994 version. Article 3 of the new Regulations explicitly stipulates that “ general education approach, ” namely inclusive education, should be given priority. According to the government, as of 2017, over 50% of students with disabilities receiving compulsory \neducation studied at regular schools. 113 The number of students with disabilities at regular schools has increased from 239,000 in 2015 to 439,000 in 2020. 114 \nMeanwhile, the revised Regulations, as well as policy directives such as the National Long-Term Educational Reform and Development Plan (2010 –2020), continues to encourage the expansion of special education. Namely, China takes a “ double-track approach ” that promotes both special education and inclusive education. 115 Challenges to inclusive education include China ’s typically large class size, the lack of special education expertise among teachers, limited resources, and ableist attitudes. Further, the double-track approach places emphasis on students ’ abilities to adapt to ordinary classes instead of capacity building of regular education system to attend to the diverse learning needs of learners with and without disabilities. The system also entrenches the rigid separation of expertise between regular school and special school teachers, and creates incentives for the special education system to retain students within special schools rather than supporting them in an inclusive setting. 116 \nPreschool and Compulsory education (elementary and middle school) Students with disabilities typically receive education through systems of special education, special classes in mainstream schools, learning in regular classes (sui ban jiu du), or home schooling (song jiao shang men). At the pre-school level, kindergartens lack the support system and technical skills to include children with disabilities, despite policy support such as the 14 th Special Education Development and Improvement Action Plan. 117 \nAccess to compulsory education is still uneven. In remoteand rural areas, students with disabilities receive lower levels of education, less access to special education teachers, and other support services necessary for education. 118 Students who learn in regular classes lack quality education, as regular school teachers lack special education capacity. Regular schools that do have special education resource centers tend to prioritize facilities and equipment, downplaying the role of specialized staff. For home schooling, students with multiple or severe disabilities, including people with autism and cerebral palsy, face significant barriers in obtaining quality education. 119 High school and vocational education Fewer students with disabilities receive post-compulsory education such as high school and vocational education, compared to students without disabilities. Between 2012 and 2016, roughly 30% of persons with disabilities, and over 85% of persons without disabilities entered high school and vocational schools. 120 Vocational education for persons with disabilities are disproportionately situated in large cities and have limited enrolment capacity, leaving the vocational training needs for students with disabilities 116 Ibid. \nhttps://k.sina.com.cn/article_1881124713_701faf69020015r80.html#/ largely unmet. 121 Existing schools also focus on students with hearing or visual impairments, and lack the expertise to train persons with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities. Current vocational trainings do not coordinate well with special schools, or future employers. 122 Higher education Higher education remains largely inaccessible to persons with disabilities. As of 2019, a total of 43,900 persons with disabilities were enrolled in regular college in the entire country, 123 which means roughly 10,000 persons with disabilities graduate from college every year. By contrast, the number of college graduates without disabilities in 2020 was 8.74 million, 124 over 800 times more than persons with disabilities. Barriers faced by persons with disabilities prior to higher education include low primary school enrolment rate among persons with disabilities in rural areas, high dropout rate among children with disabilities, low educational expectation for persons with disabilities due to deeply entrenched stigma, inadequate support in school including reasonable accommodations, and limited options in colleges and majors open to persons with disabilities. 125 Due to continued advocacy, in 2014, a national policy began to allow the application for reasonable accommodations in the national college entrance exam (gaokao), and in 2017, rules on supporting students with disabilities taking regular gaokao were issued. 126 As a result, more students with disabilities were able to attend the exam, but the acceptance rate remains disproportionately low. Employment and livelihood The right to equal employment opportunities is stipulated in China ’s Constitution, the Labor Law, the LPPD, and Regulations on the Employment of Disabled Persons (2007). The Employment Promotion Law (2007) also contains an anti-discrimination provision regarding people with disabilities. 127 As a priority area of China ’s state disability programs, employment is typically included in the national five-year plans for disability. The latest 14 th Five-Year Plan sets goals for diversifying the types and improving the quality of employment of persons with disabilities. In 2022, the State Council adopted the Three-Year Action Plan on Promoting Disability Employment (2022-2024), setting the target of generating one million new jobs for persons with disabilities over three years, creating an important policy momentum. \nAs a form of affirmative action, China has adopted an employment quota scheme, one of the most important policy devices for promoting employment of persons with disabilities. Implemented in the late 1980s, this nationwide, legally binding scheme applies to all public and private sector organizations with a workforce exceeding 30 employees and operating for more than 3 years. It stipulates that at least 1.5% of all public or private entities ’ workforce must be persons with a disability, and non-compliance shall result in financial penalty paid to the Disabled Employment Security Fund (DESF), managed by the CDPF. 128 In practice, the quota policy has been poorly enforced, and even created perverse incentives such as “ fake employment ” practices that rent a disabled person ’s certificate as a token of compliance without real work opportunity. 129 Some OPDs point out that the policy may have caused more disability-based discrimination. 130 Consultations further show the complexity of the issue. Many persons with disabilities, due to systemic education and employment exclusion, end up depending on the income from renting their certificates to private companies. The funding scheme also contains a conflict of interest, as some local governments rely on DESF as a source of revenue, incentivizing officials to collect more fines than promoting real employment. 131 The overall labor participation rate remains low for persons with disabilities. Although official data estimates over half of working-age people with disabilities are employed, 132 about three quarters of these jobs are categorized as either agriculture, cultivation, or “ flexible ” employment, 133 namely temporary or part-time jobs (see Figure 1). Persons with disabilities are significantly less likely to work in higher skilled white-collar occupations. 134 As key targets of poverty alleviation, as of 2018, households of persons with disabilities earned less than 60% of the national average and the gap continues to widen. 135 Among all, persons with intellectual disabilities were least accepted by employers. According to a report based on surveys of 203 families in Guangzhou, only 2% of persons with intellectual disabilities in Guangzhou had meaningful employment. 136 A recent survey of 328 companies shows that 70.4% persons with disabilities hired by these employers are people with physical impairments, and 59.8% are in supporting or administrative roles. 137 \n131 In consultation, informants have identified multiple systemic barriers to inclusive employment, including: \n• inadequate access to equal education opportunities, including the lack of high-quality basic education, as well as vocational training and skill development opportunities for persons with disabilities; \n\n• the lack of anti-discrimination and disability mainstreaming laws and policies; \n\n• lack of public sector role models for disability-inclusive employment; \n\n• lack of disability inclusion expertise among employment service providers; \n\n• discriminatory social attitudes towards persons with disabilities by families and friends, employers, co-workers, and even persons with disabilities themselves; \n\n• Lack of accessibility and reasonable accommodations to and at workplaces. \nILO ’s Global Business and Disability Network (GBDN) China Chapter has made progress in influencing the private sector to recruit and include persons with disabilities. While attracting local companies to join GBDN-China and promoting inclusive employment practices remains a challenge, GBDN-China presents an opportunity to generate good practices and share experiences with other companies in China. Another key opportunity is the government ’s recent effort to promote public sector employment of persons with disabilities. Until now, persons with disabilities face overt discrimination when applying for government positions, including rigid physical examination criteria, lack of reasonable accommodations and accessibility, and rejection based on certain types or degrees of disability. According to an early study based on government information disclosure requests, merely 0.02% to 0.39% of civil servants in government institutions were persons with disabilities as of 2011. 139 Recent policies, such as the Measures on Public Organs, Institutions, and State-owned Enterprises Taking the Lead in Arranging Disabled Persons ’ Employment 140 and the State Council ’s 2022 Three-Year Action Plan on Promoting Disability Employment (2022-2024) 141 , have highlighted the responsibilities of the public sector in hiring persons with disabilities and fulfilling the quota policy. OPDs consulted praise the policies as a step towards better ensuring the right to work for persons with disabilities and showcasing best practices for private employers. According to government informants, currently statistics of public servants with disabilities are being collected, local institutions are submitting their hiring plans and reserving headcounts, and a priority in 2023 is to promote the revision of public servant physical exam standards. Access to justice According to a UNDP China report on Equal Access to Justice for Persons with Disabilities, 142 persons with disabilities face significant challenges in accessing the justice system. These include: \n• “ Limited legal knowledge. \n\n• Unaffordability of current legal services, and the general lack of knowledge about free legal aid services. \n\n• For persons with [psychosocial] and intellectual disabilities and others who are placed under adult guardianship, their legal capacity is restricted. \n\n• In the process of providing criminal legal aid for persons with visual, hearing, speech and mental impairments, there is a lack of effective and timely support in communication and information accessibility. \n\n• For persons with physical or visual impairments, if and when they face discrimination in the realms of transportation, education and employment, they cannot resort to the judicial system for equality. \n\n• Women with disabilities are more vulnerable to rights infringement and have less access to justice. \n\n• Continuous social discrimination and prejudice that all [persons with disabilities] face critically restricts their ability to navigate the judicial system effectively in order to realize their human rights and also undermines their confidence and adds to their already existing dismay. ” The report concludes that the key to improving equal access to justice is greater accessibility support and reasonable accommodations throughout the judicial process. \nParticipation in public and political life China is not short of policies and laws that protect the political participation right of persons with disabilities on paper. The 2008 LPPD stipulates that “ Persons with disabilities shall enjoy equal rights with other citizens in political, economic, cultural and social respects and in family life as well ” (Article 3) and that “ competent departments in charge of the organization of elections shall facilitate persons with disabilities to vote in elections. Braille ballots shall be available wherever possible ” (Article 56). 143 Mechanisms for participating in public and political life for persons with disabilities in China include taking part in voting and elections, joining representative bodies such as all levels of NPC and CPPCC, or working for state organs. There is no specific quota for persons with disabilities in the People ’s Congresses or Political Consultation Parties. In 2020, DPFs assisted 735 policy recommendations by people ’s congress and political consultation party delegates, and handled 1109 cases of their recommendations. 144 In practice, the lack of reasonable accommodations in political processes, the restrictions posed by mandatory public servant medical examinations, the tokenization of government employment quota, the preference for people with less severe disabilities, discriminatory social attitudes, and inadequate access to equal education, all contribute to the low rate of political participation of persons with disabilities. 145 Among persons with disabilities working at state institutions, persons with physical disabilities, and those with less severe disabilities are preferred. As of 2018, among local DPFs, 69.3% of municipal-level DPFs and 49.8% of county-level DPFs had staff members with disabilities. 146 As a step forward, in 2021, CDPF and four other ministries and departments issued a policy guidance regarding employing persons with disabilities in state organs, public institutions, and state-owned enterprises, explicitly requiring public sector employers to reasonably define the physical exam requirements for candidates with disabilities, and must not judge the candidates ’ health on the basis of their disability. 147 5. CRPD-compliant budgeting and financial management There are three main mechanisms for the Chinese government to fund disability-related programs: regular public budget, special subsidy, and disability employment security fund (DESF). 148 From 2013 to 2017, the fiscal allocations from all levels of the government for persons with disabilities added up to over CNY 180 billion. 149 In 2021, the national public budget expenditure on disability affairs was CNY 70.6 billion, taking up 0.287% of the total national general public budget expenditure (24567.3 billion). 150 Compared to the scale of Chinese government budget (50-70 billion CNY per year), budgets of ongoing national development and humanitarian programs funded by international development partners are negligible. \nThe expenditures on disability affairs in 2021 included 30.6 billion on living and care subsidies (43.3%), 7.2 billion on rehabilitation, 6.6 billion on employment and poverty reduction, 5.5 billion on administrative costs, and 18.8 billion categorized as other expenditures. 151 In addition, CNY 16.1 billion of national public budget was spent on special education, 0.43% of the total education expenditures (3746.9 billion). 152 Article 48 of the 2017 Regulations on the Education of Persons with Disabilities stipulates that “ the financial funds allocated for compulsory education by local people ’s governments at all levels, as well as extra charges for education collected by these governments, shall have a certain proportion set aside for compulsory education for children and adolescents with disabilities. ” 153 Yet the proportion is not specified. \n146于娣.(2020).中国特色残联组织功能研究(博士学位论文,武汉理工大学). \nMost funding allocated for educating persons with disabilities are spent on special schools, and inclusive education in regular schools lacks financial support. 154 In 2021, The Action Plan for Special Education Development (2021-2025), issued in 2022 by the MOE, intends to increase the average government expenditure on compulsory education for children with disabilities from 6,000 yuan per student now to 7,000 yuan by 2025. 155 \nThe disability employment security fund (DESF), a penalty paid by employers for failing to comply with the employment quota policy, is designed to incentivize the employment of persons with disabilities in mainstream workplaces. In practice, employers prefer to pay fines or rent disability certificates over actually hiring persons with disabilities. The DESF scheme creates a conflict of interest, as some local governments treat employment security fund as a source of revenue, incentivizing officials to collect more fines than promoting real employment. 156 The amount of DESF increased by ten times between 2005 and 2013, but the quota-based employment rate of persons with disabilities dropped. 157 OPDs and the public are also concerned about the lack of transparency of the distribution and expenditures of the fund. 158 6. Accountability and governance \n6.1 Inclusive evidence and data gathering systems Two national sample surveys on disability were conducted in 1987 and 2006. There is no updated national disability sample survey so far. The CDPF and its local branches publish annual data updates, including statistical briefs and yearbooks on disability affairs. Key priorities of the DPF system are monitored, including rehabilitation, education, employment, social protection, poverty reduction, culture, sports, and rights protection. Other data collection efforts include the annual income level survey for households of persons with disabilities since 2017, conducted by the CDPF with the approval of the National Statistics Bureau, sampling over 10,000 households every year. 159 \nA recent initiative of China ’s disability data system is a national database that regularly and comprehensively collects information from all disability certificate holders, across the country. Key data is publicized on CDPF ’s website, and accessible for public use: https://www.cdpf.org.cn/zwgk/zccx/ndsj/zhsjtj/2021zh/87373b76fe2e47789b24f2d481afebbc.htm. \nData in some thematic areas are disaggregated by age, types of disability, and location, but not by gender. Existing data do not assess barriers to participation, or intersectional issues related to disability other than poverty. Data experts consulted raised concerns about the reliability of self-reported data by local governments, and the limited scope of disability certificate holders. \nA common response among informants is the general lack of reliable data on disability, let alone data specifically aligned with the disability definition of the CRPD, or SDG indicators. Government informants https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/90124/CC035_12_03_Disability_Workplace_China_Situation_Assess.pdf?sequence=1 \nalso note the lack of disaggregated data by disability in national statistical datasets across sectors. The data gaps and opportunities that informants identified include: \n• an updated accounting of the number of persons with disabilities based on definitions aligned with the CRPD, including those without the disability certificates; \n\n• data on people who newly acquired disabilities; \n\n• data on marginalized communities, such as persons with psychosocial disabilities, women with disabilities, and persons with disabilities residing in rural areas; \n\n• inclusive education, and employment data disaggregated by types of disabilities; \n\n• language use (Chinese sign language, written Chinese, signing exact Chinese) among people with hearing impairments \n\n• economic impact of the employment of persons with disabilities, including on their families and communities; \n\n• and mainstream, national data disaggregated by disability. 6.2 National accountability mechanisms Officially, the State Council Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work is responsible for promoting the implementation of the CRPD. Information on the effectiveness of the Committee in mainstreaming CRPD across all sectors and levels of government is lacking. 160 There is no independent mechanism appointed to monitor the implementation of the CRPD. 161 \nThe CDPF is the focal point overseeing the implementation of the CRPD, responsible for monitoring whether the creation and implementation of policies and plans relating to the rights of persons with disabilities are consistent with the CRPD principles. Some CSOs were invited to consultations for CRPD reporting but OPDs were underrepresented. 162 Most CSOs involved were specialized associations funded by the CDPF, or service provision organizations led by people without disabilities. In 2018, the State Council Committee on Disabled Persons ’ Work published China ’s draft CRPD country report for public opinions, but the time window was fewer than 24 hours, making it impractical for meaningful comments to be incorporated. 163 A few OPDs have engaged in CRPD monitoring through shadow reporting, but most OPDs consulted have not engaged in CRPD monitoring mechanisms. \nChina has completed its combined second and third periodic reports. The review sessions concluded in September 2022. Major findings of the concluding observations suggest that China ’s disability-related policies and laws are not yet fully aligned with the social model of disability, OPDs independent from the state lack meaningful participation in policy-making, and China ’s legal system lacks anti-discrimination frameworks and effective provisions guaranteeing reasonable accommodations. 164 \nIn China ’s National Plan on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 165 disability was explicitly mentioned in China ’s action plan for goal 4 (quality education), 8 (decent work and economic growth), and 10 (reduced inequalities). In China ’s Progress Report on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2021), persons with disabilities were reported as beneficiaries of China ’s progress on SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG4 (quality education), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). 166 Concrete achievements include: \n• “ To ensure the right to education for people with disabilities, the second phase of the Special Educational Enhancement Program was fully completed from 2017 to 2020. By the end of 2020, the enrollment rate of children with disabilities in compulsory education exceeded 95%; a total of 880,800 special education students had been enrolled, 388,800 more than in 2016. ” \n\n• “ From 2016 to 2020, 1.81 million people with disabilities got employed in urban and rural areas. As of the end of 2020, 2.39 million people with disabilities obtained flexible employment (including community and home employment). ” 167 \nIn China ’s 2021 Voluntary National Review, people with disabilities are mentioned as beneficiaries of China ’s efforts in SDG 1.5, the world ’s largest social security system, and COVID response. No specific evidence was provided regarding the implementation of the disability-related goals listed in China ’s Action Plan. 168 \nChina has not yet established an independent mechanism for monitoring human rights. 169 Since 2009, China has released four national human rights action plans. Outcomes of the plans are regularly reported in government issued human rights white papers. 170 The latest plan is the Human Rights Action Plan of China (2021-2025). The Action Plan includes persons with disabilities as one of the “ special groups ” and recognized the intersectional issues faced by children, women, and elderly people with disabilities. The Action Plan dedicates a targeted section on disability, stating “ ensuring the right to participate ” as a priority. Implementation of the Action Plan is mainly monitored through a joint meeting mechanism. 7. Cross cutting issues \n7.1 Participation Within the government system, there exist formal mechanisms to facilitate OPD participation in policymaking and decision-making. For instance, the Disabled People ’s Representative Congress, which is meant to function as the disabled persons ’ equivalent of the National People ’s Congress, represents the highest power overseeing the CDPF and is required to reserve at least half of its seats to persons with disabilities and their families/friends. 171 The five specialized associations, predominantly functioning as internal parts of the DPFs, are dedicated to serving the interests of people with the kinds of disabilities they represent, and are usually headed by people with the same kinds of disabilities or their families/friends. The CDPF also encourages more persons with disabilities and their families/friends to become NPC and CPPCC delegates. \n167 Ibid. \nOPDs independent from the government are involved in policy-making and decision-making to a much less extent, as consultations show. Most laws and regulations concerning disability pass without the formal input of non-state affiliated OPDs. An exception is the recent draft Law on Construction of BarrierFree Environments. The draft law was open for public comments in 2022 and 2023, and multiple OPDs organized public consultations and submitted comments. Results of their advocacy remain to be seen. Despite the lack of formal engagement, some independent OPDs have leveraged informal channels through key decision-makers, academics, NPC and CPPCC delegates to influence policy and law making. For instance, informants note that the inclusion of accessibility provisions in the Legal Aid Law was achieved through OPD collaboration with academic think tanks. \nConsultations show that formal mechanisms for participation tend to be highly selective, and exclusively accessed by CSOs, OPDs, or individuals with disabilities that are affiliated with or endorsed by the government, who take a rather service-oriented than rights-based approach. Most formal mechanisms are symbolic. As informants comment, meaningful dialogues are difficult due to power imbalances, and a lack of recognition of OPDs ’ leadership in disability inclusion. Meanwhile, the effect of informal mechanisms is not guaranteed, and depends highly on personal circumstances and political opportunities. Most grassroots OPDs, in reality, lack access to such mechanisms. Comprehensive assessment of different approaches for OPDs to influence decision making is not available, and is worthy of future research. \nAccording to various stakeholders, key areas of improvement for OPDs to make engagement with duty bearers include: better knowledge of existing policies; more access to official channels; stronger coordination between OPDs and policy makers/advocates (such as think thanks, scholars, and NPC/CPPCC representatives); higher awareness of the expertise and capacity of OPDs; and mechanisms that prioritizes the voices of independent OPDs. 7.2 Inclusion of marginalised groups \nPeople with disabilities with low income The correlation between poverty and disability is globally known, and China is no exception. Officially, over 7 million persons with disabilities have been lifted out of absolute poverty by 2021. 172 Yet persons with disabilities remain economically marginalized. Depending on the evaluation criteria, experts estimate that 36% to 44% of certified persons with disabilities in China can be considered under “ relative poverty. ” 173 As a CDPF official points out, households of persons with disabilities persistently earn less than 60% of the national average, and the gap continues to widen (see Figure 2). 174 \nHouseholds of persons with disabilities typically have “ high costs, low income. ” In 2018, healthcare expenses of families of persons with disabilities make up 26.3% of total household expenditures, 1.6 times that of the national average. The Engel's Coefficient (food expenditure to overall expenditure ratio) of persons with disabilities was as high as 40.9% in 2018, significantly higher than the national average (28.4%). 176 The least well-off among people with disabilities live in rural areas. In 2018, urban households of persons with disabilities earned 1.7 times more than rural households. Among the rural population with disabilities, over half have severe disabilities (holders of Level 1 or Level 2 certificates). 177 This indicates a greater gap in meeting their needs for care, accessibility, rehabilitation, assistive devices, basic public services, and work, exacerbating their poverty. \nPeople with intellectual and/or psychosocial disabilities People with intellectual disabilities fare the worst economically among all persons with disabilities. In 2018, the average personal annual income for people with intellectual disabilities was CNY 11,388.3, roughly 70% of the income of people with physical disabilities, the highest income group. Their average salary income was a mere CNY 1,600.4 per year, lowest among all persons with disabilities, indicating their lack of access to formal employment opportunities. 178 In consultation, parents are the primary caregivers of persons with intellectual disabilities. They lack support from the government and alternative options for caregiving, and are concerned about the absence of affordable, high-quality care as they reach older age or pass away. \nFor people with psychosocial disabilities, an early analysis based on the 2006 disability sample survey data found that “ psychiatric disability, ” as defined by Chinese law, was significantly correlated with poverty. 179 Expert informants are concerned that institutional paternalism and stigma has led to substituted decisionmaking instead of supported decision making that respects the person ’s autonomy, lack of recognition of legal capacity, and restricted social participation of persons with psychosocial disabilities. Although China ’s Mental Health Law stipulates the right to litigation and the principle of voluntary diagnosis and hospitalization, in judicial practices, persons with psychosocial disabilities still lack decision-making power and court decisions continue to emphasize the role of legal guardians and family members. 180 The scarcity of high-quality community-based services is also a reality. \nDuring the latest review, the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities raised concerns about the use of coercive measures to institutionalize persons with intellectual and/or psychosocial disabilities, such as shackling, chaining, and medical restraints in China. 181 Reports have also been made about practices that restrict the reproductive rights of persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities, such as forced sterilization, abortion, castration and contraception. 182 Early in 2022, video of a chained woman, mother of eight children in a village in East China, led to public outcry about the violence and abuse against women with psychosocial disabilities in rural China, 183 who are particularly vulnerable to gender-based violence, including domestic violence, forced marriage, and trafficking. 7.3 Gender equality Women with disabilities face disproportionate, multiple discrimination caused by the intersection of gender, disability, and class. 184 An early study (2001-2010) funded by the State Council Committee on Women and Children ’s Work and CDPF shows that in 2010, 55.3% of women with disabilities never received any education, 27.9 percentage points higher than men with disabilities. A mere 26.4% of women with disabilities were employed, 12.4 percentage points lower than men with disabilities. In 2010, the average annual income of women with disabilities was CNY 3,501, making up only 44.1% of total women ’s income, and 85.9% of the income of men with disabilities. The situation is worse in rural areas. Among rural women with disabilities, only 4.3% of received education above high school level, and 33.7% were illiterate. For rural women with disabilities, their average annual income was CNY 1,173, less than one third of urban women with disabilities, and roughly half of them were entirely financially dependent on family members. Rural women with disabilities also reported higher incidents of domestic violence (20.7%) than women with disabilities in general (19.1%). 185 A 2015 baseline study jointly conducted by Sichuan University, a local DPF, and a women ’s federation, found that among the 113 government officials (city, district, county, and village level) they surveyed, most did not think women with disabilities face more discrimination, and 88.5% believed that gender-specific services were not necessary. Only 3-5% of officials had exposure to SOGI related trainings, and 35.4% received trainings on disability rights protection. 186 A decade later, women with disabilities face continued barriers in care, marriage and social life, reproductive health care, and equal opportunities to employment, as shown in a women ’s OPD survey of 535 women with disabilities. 187 Another recent multi-year OPD survey of 1,083 women with disabilities reveals that as high as 33% of them were once told to discontinue their education. Among educated informants, 24% experienced dropout because of their disability. 54.3% of women studied were not employed, for whom caretaking responsibilities and unsuccessful job seeking are the main reasons. Over half of the women reported experiences of rejection for job opportunities because of their disability, and 34.4% because of their gender. Most working women, on the other hand, received no support on workplace accessibility and reasonable accommodation, and 44.7% of them did not receive equal pay for equal work. Over half of the informants reported personal income as lower than CNY 2000 per month. 36.3% of women surveyed in 2020 experienced loss of income due to COVID-19. 188 \nIn 2020, the CDPF, supported by UN ESCAP, UN Women, UNFPA, and Rehabilitation International, released a “ Call to Action: Enabling Sisters with Disabilities to Join in Shaping the Future We Want ” in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action at the Fourth World Conference on Women, and the fifth year of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Promoting adequate standard of living, health, and education of women and girls with disabilities are among the top of the list of call for actions. Sexual and reproductive health is considered a key entry point of intervention for women and LGBTI persons with disabilities by consulted stakeholders, which, in the context of China, connects cross-cutting issues of healthcare, education, employment, accessibility, anti-violence, and rights awareness raising for persons with disabilities. 8. Disability Inclusion in Broader Development, Humanitarian & Emergency Contexts \n8.1 National Development Plans In China ’s National Plan on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 189 disability was explicitly mentioned in China ’s action plan for goal 4 (quality education), 8 (decent work and economic growth), and 10 (reduced inequalities). Specifically, China ’s actions plans with explicit reference to disability include: \n\n• SDG 4.2: Improve the funding system for preschool education to help the less-privileged, such as children from needy families, orphans and children with disabilities, to gain access to public preschool education. Improve the quality of kindergarten teachers \n\n• SDG 4.5: Protect everyone ’s right including that of vulnerable groups to education, and improve special education. Open special education schools in counties with more than 300,000 residents and gradually ensure 12-year free education for children with disabilities, covering the 9-year compulsory education and the senior high school education. \n\n• SDG 8.5: Increase labor force participation rate through implementation of the classification policy. Vigorously enforce the Law on Promotion of Employment. Targeted measures have been formulated to promote employment of university graduates, migrant workers, people with disabilities, retired soldiers, women and some other groups. Improve employment and entrepreneurship services and launch a lifelong vocational training initiative. \n\n• SDG 8.10: Implement the Plan for Promoting the Development of Financial Inclusion(2016-2020) to establish, by 2020, an inclusive financial services and security system to increase the accessibility of timely, affordable, and convenient financial services for the general public, especially for small and micro enterprises, farmers, urban low-incomers, poor people, people with disabilities and the elderly. By 2020, establish a modern insurance industry that is comprehensive, stable, well-functioning and credible. \n\n• SDG 10.3: Establish a more equitable and sustainable social protection system that better protect rights and interests of vulnerable social groups such as women, minors, and people with disabilities. \nIn China ’s Progress Report on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2021), persons with disabilities were reported as beneficiaries of China ’s progress on SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG4 (quality education), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). 190 In China ’s 2021 Voluntary National Review, people with disabilities are mentioned as beneficiaries of China ’s efforts in SDG 1.5, the world ’s largest social security system, and COVID response. No specific evidence was provided regarding the implementation of the disability-related goals listed in China ’s Action Plan. 191 There is no reference to OPD participation or capacity development support of OPDs in the Action Plan, Progress Report, or Voluntary National Review. \nThe UNSDCF (2021-2025) with China included disability-related support in “ Outcome 2: People ’s lives in China are improved further as headway is made in ensuring access to childcare, education, healthcare services, elderly care, housing, and social assistance, and more people in China, including left-behind groups, benefit from equitable and high-quality public services and social protection systems as well as accelerated efforts to reduce gender inequality and other forms of social inequality throughout the lifecourse. ” 192 The UNTGD is fully consulted in the country plans and strategies, processes and reporting. Other bilateral agencies and donors promote and engage in disability rights through their participation in the UNTGD meetings and activities, but most from disability-specific rather than disability mainstreaming perspectives. 8.2 Disaster risk reduction & humanitarian action Disability perspective has not been mainstreamed into China ’s disaster risk reduction (DRR) system. China ’s current Emergency Response Law has no specific provisions regarding targeted protections for vulnerable populations, including children, elderly people, and people with disabilities. 193 Article 70 of the Law on Protecting Against and Mitigating Earthquake Disasters requires post-disaster reconstruction to coordinate with the construction of accessible facilities, but the Law does not make explicit reference to the protection of persons with disabilities. 194 \nChina does have a few disability-specific policy directives that included DRR concerns. For instance, the Opinion on Strengthening Social Assistance for Persons with Disabilities, issued by CDPF in 2015, called for meeting the basic needs of persons with disabilities affected by disasters. 195 China ’s regulations and national plans on “ disability prevention ” also set the reduction of disaster-induced disabilities as targets. As a result, the disability-related tasks assigned to China ’s Ministry of Emergency Management is more aimed at preventing disability, less so at providing disability-inclusive services. 196 As COVID-19 heightened the lack of disability-inclusivity in China ’s emergency response system, Zhang Haidi, Chairwoman of CDPF, in her capacity as the Standing Committee Member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, raised policy recommendations that DRR related laws and policies should specify the protection of persons with disabilities and include accessibility, emergency information and DRR facilities should be made accessible, and the capacity of DRR service providers in protecting persons with disabilities should be strengthened. 197 Article 34 of China ’s Civil Code stipulates temporary caregiving services for people whose legal guardians are unavailable during emergencies. This is regarded as an advocacy success by OPDs, triggered by the tragic death of a 16-yearold teenager with cerebral palsy, a week after he was left unattended due to caregivers being taken to COVID-19 quarantine in early 2020. 198 In general, OPDs are not regularly consulted within the civil protection system or humanitarian system in planning and implementation of DRR/humanitarian efforts. 8.3 Climate Change The 2020 China Report of the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change pointed out disproportionate health risks posed by climate change on those living in poverty, with social disadvantages, and older people ( ≥65 years old). For instance, people above 65 years old face a 10.4% higher risk of dying in a heatwave, the mortality of which has risen by a factor of four from 1990 to 2019. 199 Demographically, these groups significantly overlap with China ’s persons with disabilities. \nDespite the urgency, persons with disabilities or OPDs are in general not included in climate change analyses, plans and programmes in China. In turn, OPDs and disability CSOs do not generally work on climate change issues. Occasionally, OPDs have mobilized and provided targeted community support during climate change related emergencies. For instance, when a severe flooding hit Henan Province in 2021, deaf persons led organization Know Deaf published guidelines for effectively rescuing people with 31726277.html \ndifferent kinds of disabilities during floods. 200 Systemic coordination between climate change and disability programs is lacking. 8.4 COVID-19 The Law on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, which is the legal basis for China ’s COVID policies, is criticized for lacking a disability lens and overlooks the needs of persons with disabilities in terms of access to information, basic goods and services, medications and assistive devices, and care. 201 In 2020, the CDPF issued a Guideline on the Protection of Disabled Persons in Severe Infectious Disease Epidemics, which mainly provides generic guidance for self-protection. 202 \nIn 2021, Raoul Wallenberg Institute of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law conducted a participatory action research with the OPD Minority Voices, offering the first comprehensive study of COVID-19 experiences of persons with disabilities. According to the report, persons with disabilities have experienced disruptions of access to regular healthcare, community living, employment, and education during lockdowns. Top unmet needs include purchasing medical supplies, worsened mental health, paused access to delivery services, sense of isolation, lack of financial relief, loss of livelihood, lack of remote learning support, and inaccessibility of remote learning tools. 203 In response, OPDs, volunteer groups, and individuals with disabilities have actively participated in community-level mutual assistance, and disability-inclusive advocacy. For instance, in early 2020, deaf persons ’ organization ProSigner, based in Wuhan, organized to support local deaf communities to access accurate public health information and distributing medical supplies such as masks, disinfectants, and gloves. 204 A network of volunteers from across the country organized to support people with disabilities in coordination with local CSOs, providing information, shopping, counselling, and resource referral services. Inclusion China launched a mutual assistance network among families of people with intellectual disabilities. Multiple OPDs/CSOs such as One Plus One, Able Development Institute, Voices of the Disabled, and the Disability COVID Support Volunteer Network, drafted specific handbooks and guidelines regarding the science of COVID, self-protection measures, response to domestic violence during quarantine, and accessible emergency response and service provision. Women ’s OPD BEST organized donations of sanitary care products for women with disabilities. 205 \nhttps://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/C_GmGMiqGQI3teh9QK_JtQ This section focuses on the overall key challenges in systems, structures, practices, and capacities and discusses the underlying causes. Specific gaps under each area of inquiry will not be repeated here. Analysis of key gaps and opportunities \nGaps Equality and non-discrimination: Attitudinal barriers are considered by stakeholders as one of the most fundamental challenges that cuts across all preconditions for inclusion. Progress has been made since the adoption of CRPD in 2008 in terms of awareness-raising of the social model of disability, especially among development partners and OPDs/CSOs. Yet the Chinese society at large and its corresponding systems are predominantly taking a medical model approach to disability, regarding persons with disabilities as subjects of charity and welfare in need of special rather than mainstream services. Policy makers and service providers, especially at grassroots levels, lack the awareness and buy-in of CRPD or the social model of disability. Laws and regulations relevant to disability are not fully aligned with the CRPD, and lack strength in enforcement and remedies. \nInclusive Service Delivery: The current policy frameworks tend to regard persons with disabilities as welfare beneficiaries more than rights holders. Public provision of disability support services prioritize social protection, subsidies, and rehabilitation, less focused on building support systems for the equal participation of persons with disabilities in society, such as inclusive education and employment. Policy makers are incentivized to maximize service coverage for the large population of persons with disabilities with limited resources, de-emphasizing the quality of services. The agency and autonomy of persons with disabilities is downplayed. As reflected in multi-stakeholder consultations, OPDs are concerned about the policy focus on family ’s responsibility in caregiving for persons with disabilities, without sufficient government support. \nAccessibility: Unchecked discrimination against persons with disabilities, combined with the lack of reasonable accommodations and accessibility, pose consistent barriers in all aspects of social participation of persons with disabilities. Despite increased government investment in accessibility, weak enforcement, insufficient remedies, and the lack of meaningful participation of persons with disabilities in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of accessible tools and standards has resulted in the poor quality of accessibility measures. As shown in the draft Law on the Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, there is also a tendency to prioritize physical environment over access to information and service provision, especially for persons with intellectual or psychosocial impairments, and deaf people/persons with hearing impairments. \nAccountability and Governance: Disability has not yet been mainstreamed into the current governance structure. The CDPF system is assigned the responsibility for disability inclusion but with insufficient authority to coordinate with other ministries. This relatively segregated coordination mechanism within the government, according to stakeholders consulted, can form barriers for OPDs to engage mainstream ministries and obtain resources from the government which are concentrated within the DPF system. Consistent data collections on disability inclusion aligned with the CRPD and SDGs are lacking. Official statistics on disability adopt impairment-based definitions of disability and does not comply with the ICF or CRPD definitions of disability. Further, stakeholders are concerned about the reliability of self-reported data, the transparency of data, and the lack of disaggregated data by disability in mainstream data collections. \nCRPD-compliant budgeting: Despite the much larger size compared to development partners, government budgeting prioritizes welfare provision over rights protection, and special rather than mainstream services. Significant power and resource imbalances exist between the duty bearers and rights holders. While development partners are reducing support for countries like China as its income level grows, development programs funded by foreign entities are under increasing legal and administrative scrutiny. This has impacted the development of independent OPDs which lack access to government resources. Participation: OPDs independent from the government lack the opportunity to participate meaningfully in policy and decision making. Formal mechanisms for OPD participation prefer state-affiliated, serviceoriented organizations/individuals. Many independent OPDs operate as unregistered, self-help groups run by volunteers, in the absence of sufficient financial and human resources for professionalization. Compared to other CSOs, leaders with disabilities have lower social capital due to systemic exclusion in education, community participation, and other critical life opportunities. While grassroots OPDs are often blamed for lacking the capacity to engage in policy making and development programs, mechanisms for engagement fail to consider these preexisting disadvantages and provide support systems to prioritize the voices of persons with disabilities, especially the most marginalized. Even at occasions for dialogues with policy makers, grassroots OPDs and leaders with disabilities experience significant power imbalances in the authority to speak about disability and access to resources, compared to experts, professionals, and decision-makers without disabilities. They see such engagement as “ unbalanced, insufficient, and unequal. ” \nInequalities and Gender: Persons with disabilities in rural areas, who constitute the majority of the disabled population in China, are still largely unreached by development programs. They face harsher living conditions, and more likelihood to acquire severe disabilities, but less access to healthcare, education, employment, and accessible environment. Due to the financial structure of local DPFs, which obtain funding from same-level government instead of the CDPF, areas that are less economically developed tend to have lower budget on disability, despite higher needs. Among these groups, women with disabilities and people with multiple disabilities are further disadvantaged. Yet existing government and development programs tend to consider gender and disability in isolation, resulting in the lack of gender awareness in disability inclusion programs and policies, and vice versa. Opportunities Having completed the poverty alleviation campaign in 2020, the government ’s ongoing priority is rural revitalization and achieving common prosperity, namely, reducing inequalities and income gaps between urban and rural areas. Persons with disabilities significantly overlap with China ’s most impoverished population. Increasing high-quality jobs is a key approach for economic empowerment, especially during China ’s post-COVID economic recovery. In 2022, the State Council adopted the Three-Year Action Plan on Promoting Disability Employment (2022-2024), setting the target of generating one million new jobs for persons with disabilities over three years, and encouraging the public sector to take the lead in hiring persons with disabilities. Changes in the private sector are also happening, such as the global push for more stakeholder-centric approach to doing business, including the Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) framework. More corporations begin to adopt disability inclusion in their ESG framework, providing an entry-point for disability-inclusive employment. As such, stakeholders of disability inclusion see opportunities in promoting decent work in government, big corporations, and rural areas. This can also pave the way for more meaningful participation in policy and decision making, as more persons with disabilities enter the public and private sector as employees. China ’s ageing population has made the provision of accessible environment and services ever more urgent. COVID-19 also heightened the issue of digital divide in China, making it pressing for improving the digital accessibility and digital literacy among persons with disabilities and elderly people. The new Law on the Construction of Barrier-Free Environments, passed on June 28, 2023, is indicative of the growing importance of accessibility in recent years, and creates a policy window for more awareness-raising on accessibility, including built environment, information and communication, and services. Although the second draft of the law is still criticized for having “ no teeth ” or remedies, its symbolic presence can boost the legitimacy of local OPDs ’ existing efforts in requesting access with public service providers (e.g. subway, banks, etc.). Government stakeholders also foresee needs for technical and publicity support on promoting the new legislation and specifying local-level enforcement measures. In addition, policies like the 2021 Special Action Plan on Elderly-oriented and Barrier-free Modifications for Internet Applications, the 2021 Action Plan on Improving National Digital Literacy and Skills, and China ’s entry into the Marrakesh Treaty, create incentives for more stakeholders to engage in accessibility. To take advantage of these developments, OPDs call for attention to the digital literacy divide caused by lack of access to digital tools or skills. \nChina ’s population policies have been undergoing transformations in recent years. Since 2021, couples in China are allowed to have three children with support measures. 206 In 2022, China witnessed its first population decline in 60 years. 207 While family planning policies continue to relax and policy incentives for child-rearing increase, the implications for persons with disabilities are unclear. On one hand, persons with disabilities lack equal access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) care; on the other hand, preventing disability remains a health target in national health strategies. 208 To maximize the benefits and minimize the harm of the increased investment in population growth and health management, the SRH needs of persons with disabilities warrant attention. Meanwhile, SRH offers an entry-point for persons with disabilities to address cross-cutting issues such as gender-based violence, education and health inequity, and the agency and autonomy of individuals with disabilities. \nA potential mechanism to expand OPD participation in decision-making is to take part in research that can serve as evidence for policy making. This is in line with the Communist Party ’s recent promotion for research and survey among Party members to better connect policy and practice. 209 Best practices include OPDs organizing community focus groups and partnering with scholars involved in policy making to submit proposals or policy opinions; combining short-term trainings with long-term regular research groups; and co-authoring independent surveys/study reports with subject matter experts. \nA gradual cultural shift is taking place from the medical model to the social model. More self-advocates with disabilities and new narratives are emerging in mainstream and social media, challenging stereotypes about disability. These circumstances present a crucial opportunity for the UN to leverage its influence, such as advocating for policy changes that align with the CRPD, building capacity and providing platforms for OPDs and individual advocates, and support the government, including CDPF and other ministries, in promoting inclusive services. Recommendations for UNCT action 1. To continue to raise awareness of the social model of disability among policy makers, service providers, and key decision-makers in all interactions between the UN and the stakeholders participating in the three prioritised UNPRPD programme areas; cultural and educational services, employment and SRHR. Previous UNPRPD programs have successfully engaged legal professionals, educators, media, and employers through disability mainstreaming trainings such as the Disability Equality Trainings (DET). Future programs should prioritize local DPFs and service providers, lawmakers, key ministries such as the National Health Commission, Ministry of Civil Affairs, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Culture and Tourism, Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and even Party institutions such as the Central Party School. Strengthen the role of OPDs and trainers/facilitators with disabilities in awareness raising programs. In addition to short-term training programs, design opportunities for longterm engagement, such as credit course in universities, or join participatory action research programs. \n2. To support the implementation of the newly passed Law on the Construction of Barrier-Free Environments and related policies by ¨ \na) Supporting selected local governments to develop concrete implementation plans (as models of good practice), with focus on culture, employment and SRHR. After the law comes into effect, local governments will develop local implementation guidelines, which can be an opportunity to specify and translate the principles of the law into more concrete requirements. Based on the law, the UN can facilitate government coordination at the local level, between the DPF, and departments of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, Civil Affairs, Industry and Information Technology, Transport, Culture and Tourism, Education, and Health Commissions. The UN can support the promotion of the content of the law among stakeholders, and the development of guidelines in specific areas, such as how OPDs and individuals can use the law to protect their own rights, and implement barrier-free and reasonable accommodation provisions in schools, workplaces, museums etc,. Programs should be sensitive to the urban-rural divide. \nb) Supporting technology cooperations, vocational education partners and OPDs to improve the accessibility of internet and digital tools and enhancing the skills for persons with disabilities to make use of digital tools with focus on education, employment, SRHR and advocacy. This will contribute to reducing the digital divide among persons with disabilities – especially marginalized groups such as person with intellectual disabilities and women with disabilities in rural areas. This will also promote the right to information and further implementation of the Marrakesh Treaty, the Special Action Plan on Elderly-oriented and Barrier-free Modifications for Internet Applications, and Action Plan on Improving National Digital Literacy and Skills. Consider leveraging ongoing policy support for vocational education in promoting information and digital literacy. 3. To support the implementation of the State Council Three-Year Action Plan on Promoting Disability Employment by providing support to the local partners of the GBDN-China network to develop guidance on disability inclusion for employers in the public/private sector. Use the momentum of the government ’s directives on strengthening vocational education to demonstrate how to include vocational trainings of persons with disabilities in programmes, with special focus on the urban-rural divide, leveraging the government ’s ongoing focus on rural revitalization. Previous development programs have focused on educating and supporting private sector employers, and concentrated in big corporations and cities. Building on the success, future programs can consider expanding these efforts to the public sector, companies with global supply chains, the digital economy, or remote areas. In the short term, OPDs and employment service providers can benefit from strengthening their expertise in employer engagement, job redesign, and employee support, and learning about concrete, best practices of disability-inclusive employment sensitive to local contexts, preferably disaggregated by impairment, degree of disability, and gender.. Programs should prioritize the leadership of OPDs,. \n4. To support improvements in accessibility and availability of disability inclusive SRHR information and services by developing, testing and putting to use materials, tools and communication methods that help to raise the awareness and capacity of OPDs on SRHR advocacy and the awareness and capacity of service providers to deliver better availability, accessibility, acceptance and quality of services. Use SRH as an entry point to enhance the mutual mainstreaming of disability and gender programs, and strengthen the safety, agency, life opportunities, and autonomy of women and girls with disabilities. \n5. To enhance coordination between stakeholders by strengthening UNCT partnerships with not only the DPFs but also other ministries, especially at the local level. Utilize the UN ’s convening power to engage ministries and departments, breaking the silos between DPFs, OPDs, and different government departments. Engage grassroots OPDs, local government departments and DPFs. This can help strengthen their coordination at the local levels, build support networks for local OPDs, and localize CRPD implementation in ways that account for local realities. The CDPF also conveyed some local DPFs ’ interests for international cooperation. \n6. To enhance the knowledge base of UNCT and national stakeholders on disability inclusion, in line with the CRPD to better understand gaps and opportunities. This will be used to inform future action. This analysis has identified a few areas that need further research by the UNCT, including: \n• The development of independent OPDs across China, especially in smaller cities/rural areas \n\n• Effectiveness of formal and informal participation mechanisms for state and non-state affiliated OPDs \n\n• The economic impact of inclusive education and employment of persons with disabilities on individual, family and community economy \n\n• The collection of general mainstream data, disaggregated by disability, including impairment type, degree, location, and gender. 7. To establish meaningful mechanisms to enhance OPD participation and amplify the voices of persons with disabilities in UN supported programmes. For instance, within the UNPRPD program, pilot test a mechanism for OPDs to partner with scholars/CSOs/think tanks/associations on evidence-based policy advocacy. The latter stakeholders can function as intermediaries between grassroots OPDs and policy makers. The collaboration mechanism should combine OPDs ’ disability-specific expertise, with the allies ’ domain-specific expertise and government access (e.g. education, health/SRHR, employment, or accessibility), and produce joint products for policy advocacy (e.g. reports, policy proposals, internal briefings, or pilot programs). The mechanism should fully leverage OPDs ’ leadership and expertise in analyzing community needs, while strengthening OPDs ’ policy advocacy skills and local-level support networks. It should also serve to increase the disability inclusion awareness and capabilities of domain experts. OPDs shall play a leading role in the mechanism, with sufficient decision-making power at each stage of the project, rather than mere data collectors. The UN should aim for creating opportunities for de-bureaucratized, informal engagement among stakeholders. \n8. To strengthen the resources and capacity for grassroots OPDs to participate in policy making, implementation, and monitoring in UN funded programmes. This could serve as models of good practice for other local programmes. Leverage the UNPRPD program and platforms such as the UNTGD, to facilitate regular knowledge exchanges among OPDs and stakeholders on successful engagement with existing participation mechanisms. These can include best practices of partnering with governmenttrusted think tanks for policy advocacy, submitting proposals to the NPC and CPPCC sessions, engagement strategies with government entities, campaigns for mobilizing public comments on draft legislations, monitoring the implementation of accessibility standards, participation in UN human rights treaty mechanisms, and effective collaboration with the private sector. The UN should provide a safe space and allocate sufficient resources to ensure OPDs and individuals with disabilities with less access can benefit. \n9. To create platforms for capacity building and international exchange for grassroots OPDs. Although development funding is negligible compared to the scale of government budget on disability, resources for OPDs remain scarce. OPDs operating in similar social and economic contexts can share ideas and build peer-support networks. It can also increase the visibility of Chinese OPDs at the international level and share Chinese best practices with other countries. \n10. To prioritize women with disabilities and marginalized communities in the design of the PRPD program. Prioritize the leadership of women with disabilities in development programs, and support gender-sensitive approaches to disability programs, rather than merely including female participants in activities. Allocate sufficient financial and human resources to support the meaningful participation of marginalized communities, such as travel, lodging, personal assistance, and reasonable accommodations. \n11. To enhance disability and gender mutual mainstreaming within the UN system. The 2022 Disability Inclusion Scorecard Assessment shows that the UNCT still fall short in meeting Indicator 8 “ Joint programmes: Joint programmes contribute to disability inclusion ” and Indicator 9 “ Data: Strengthening data on persons with disabilities. ” OPDs expect the UN to further implement the United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy, and model best practices such as incorporating disability components, indicators, and OPDs in non-disability focused UN programs, employing persons with disabilities, enhancing the accessibility of UN offices and meetings, and increasing the collection and disclosure of data disaggregated by types of disability, degrees of disability, and location of persons with disabilities. \nwww.UNPRPD.org "

心智障碍者家庭支持计划由深圳壹基金公益基金会和水滴公司旗下水滴公益平台于2019年6月共同发起，聚焦城市及欠发达地区支持心智障碍者家庭资源中心和家长联络站的建设，为心智障碍者及其家庭照料者开展信息提供、同伴支持、家长赋能、个性化支持和社区合作等服务，在全国和地方层面进行公众和政策倡导，促进社会认知改变。项目由北京晓更基金会·融合中国心智障碍者家长组织网络项目组负责实施。 \n截至2021年12月底，心智障碍者家庭支持计划覆盖25个市县，服务了53168人次心智障碍者和49918人次家长，并入选界面新闻“ 2021年度杰出慈善案例榜单” 。通过《家庭满意度调查问卷》显示： 95%以上的家长表示，资源中心的存在可减轻孤立无援的感觉，对子女有更加多元和深入的了解，可提升面对子女问题的能力，增加寻找解决问题的方法和资源。 \n本套《心智障碍者家庭资源手册》围绕“信息提供”这一资源中心最为基础的功能，系统筛选梳理了相关信息，期望能为迷茫期的心智障碍者家长，心智障碍者及家庭的服务提供者，以及任何希望了解和支持心智障碍者的相关方提供信息参考。 前言家庭是每个人获得支持的最小社会单元。对于心智障碍者而言，他们的照料者是终生的陪伴者和支持者，只有有效地支持到家庭成员，才能够更好地促进从家庭到心智障碍者生活质量的提升。由中国精神残疾人及亲友协会编著的《中国孤独症家庭需求蓝皮书》显示： 95%的家长认为急需专业咨询及政策信息需求， 79.1%的家长认为在孩子的康复教育等方面没有获得专业化系统培训。 基于此背景，晓更基金会希望能通过这套资源手册，将有关心智障碍者的一些基本理念、知识、信息、建议等内容进行基础性的提炼汇总，各地心智障碍者家长组织或服务机构可以在本手册基础上，结合本地有关政策、服务资源、养育经验等内容进一步补充丰富，从而更好地帮助当地心智障碍者链接或获得专门化服务、主流化服务（如基本的健康、教育、就业等）以及获得主流化服务所需的辅助性服务或支持（如社区支持、家庭教育等） 。

，根据中国残疾人联合会《关于在宣传报道中规范残疾人及残疾人工作有关称谓的通知》 （残联宣文函〔 2022 〕12号） ， “统一称‘孤独症’ ，不用‘自闭症’ 。 ”故本手册正文中使用“孤独症”一词。 认识孤独症谱系障碍\n什么是孤独症谱系障碍？ 孤独症谱系障碍（ Autism Spectrum Disorder ，以下简称孤独症）是一种影响社会交往和行为发展的发育障碍，通常在出生后的几年就会被发现。 \n来源： Wiggins, L. and Rice, C., et al.,2018 \n根据美国精神病学协会最新一版《精神障碍诊断与统计手册》 (DSM-5) ，将孤独症、阿斯伯格综合征、儿童瓦解症以及未分类的广泛性发育障碍统称为孤独症谱系障碍。我国将孤独症列为精神障碍类别。 \n医学上对孤独症谱系障碍的成因尚无肯定结论，目前发生人数增长迅速，仅中国的孤独症人士已经有1000多万，其中相当一部分已经成年。男孩的发生率是女孩的4-6倍。来源：周玲， 2020 \n> \n1000多万中国孤独症人士孤独症的主要表现是社会交往障碍、交流障碍以及限定性的重复或刻板行为、兴趣和活动。来源： Wiggins, L. and Rice, C., et al.,2018) \n这些障碍会对孤独症人士在日常生活、学校、工作场所、社会中的行为和适应造成诸多挑战，也常因此被大众误解甚至污名化。这些障碍也会造成孤独症人士在各方面的发展不平衡，比如有些方面可能随年龄增长而发展，但其他方面却明显发展不足。他们很可能难以将记忆中的信息和目前发生的事件整合在一起，不懂得如何去总结经验，难以预测将会发生的事情。 \n他们有时看起来似乎对什么都漠不关心，但有时他们会对他人看来微不足道和毫无意义的特定物品或者经历表现出特别的迷恋。 \n来源: 《孤独症谱系障碍：家长及专业人员指南》洛娜·温著，孙敦科译， 2013 孤独症人士似乎完全躲在自己的世界里，专心致志于他们自己的活动中，对其他人漠不关心，跟他们打招呼、说话，他们也不会做出反应。 社会交往的障碍除了特别生气、苦恼或喜悦的时候,他们的面部可能毫无表情。 \n他们可能盯着你看，或者根本不看你,或者只是偶然斜着眼睛快速一瞥。 \n你试图拥抱或抚摸孤独症儿童，他们可能会挣脱离开，或者从你身边走过但不停留。 \n他们会抓着你的手或胳膊，用你的手去够他们想要的东西，或者去为他们执行一个动作，如转动门把手，一旦他们得到想要的那件东西，就不会再理睬你了。 \n可能在挠痒痒、晃动身体、在地板上滚动、或者追来追去的时候，孤独症儿童也许会开心大笑，甚至会看向你，希望能够继续下去，可是一旦游戏结束，他们又会回到疏离的状态。 \n有一些孤独症人士可能会主动去接近负责照料他们的人，且常常以单方面的形式提出要求，或者一而再再而三地谈到他们自己所关切的事情，却不关注对方的感情和需要。但是，如果得不到他们所要求的那种注意，他们就会变得很难相处。 \n一些高功能、语言发展水平较好的孤独症青年和成人，可能会表现得过分彬彬有礼，甚至显得有些古板。他们力图表现出良好的行为举止，却只能僵硬地固守社会互动的那些规则，因为他们虽然习得了这些规则，但并不真正理解，也难以做出因应场合的调整。 交流的障碍语言发展障碍是孤独症人士的常见状况，但严重程度各不相同，在所有孤独症人士中，大概有四分之一或五分之一从来没有语言。 \n\n很多人开始发展语言的时间要比普通儿童延迟很多，往往从重复别人的话开始，尤其是重复最后一个或几个词，可能只是原样模仿其语音和音调，但并不理解词的意义，有时也称这种情况为鹦鹉学舌似的“仿说” 。 \n\n有些人可能会常常混淆语法和词义，对于人称代词也不容易掌握，很难区分“你” “我”等身份指代。 \n\n一些孤独症人士能够与他人进行交流，但他们的语言内容是重复的，而非交谈式的。比如他们可能会重复同一个问题，尽管已经有了答案；或者不顾听众的反应，对自己特别感兴趣的内容进行独白。 \n\n他们通常只能理解语言的字面意思，无法理解比喻、暗示或者那些模棱两可的话。 \n\n孤独症人士对于非口语的表达，如手势、面部表情以及肢体动作的理解，也存在一定程度的困难。 \n孤独症儿童很难理解过家家、扮演角色这样想象性的游戏，而是更倾向于重复性的活动。有的孤独症人士会对喜欢的故事/影片情节等一遍又一遍地重复听/观看，甚至熟悉到可以整段复述，一旦漏掉一个词他们都会知道，但他们对故事情节并不具备富有想象力的理解。 重复或刻板行为、兴趣和活动很多简单的重复活动表现为各种重复的感觉，如：尝一尝、闻一闻、摸一摸、敲一敲等；听一听机械的声响；盯着灯光或者闪闪发光的东西看；扭动、转动双手或近在眼前的物品；从各种不同的角度盯着东西看；开灯、关灯；观看旋转的东西，或者自己不停地旋转；经常拍手、挥舞手臂、上下跳跃、转头、摇晃身体等。 \n有时这种重复的活动表现为咬自己、撞头、打头、抓挠等，或者其他形式的自伤行为，这类行为经常是对痛苦、愤怒或者受到挫折的一种反应，但是，自伤行为也可能成为某个人在无事可做时的一种重复的习惯。 \n有时表现在复杂重复的常规。如：要把物品排成一行，或者把物品放在固定的地方，且不准打乱；走路时喜欢走同一条路线，拐弯时喜欢拐直角等。这种常规不允许被打乱，否则会极度心烦意乱，甚至开始闹情绪。 有些孤独症人士可能对某些物品产生依恋，拒绝与之分开；或者执着于收藏一些东西，如：有的孤独症人士喜欢收集洗涤剂瓶子，有可能见到洗涤剂就去拿，无论是在自己家里、别人家里或者超市里，如果TA知道要等清空瓶子之后才能收藏， TA会去倒掉里面的洗涤剂。来源: 《孤独症谱系障碍：家长及专业人员指南》 \n\n洛娜·温著，孙敦科译， 2013 同路人语1福建省心启航助残帮助中心快乐活动营我的孩子是一个受孤独症影响的10岁男孩，他对声音敏感，语言表达困难，原来还特别挑食。他有很典型的孤独症障碍，但让我们夫妻感到欣慰的是他没有情绪和行为问题，目前顺利进入普校就读一年级(全程陪读) ，学校老师比较接纳，班级氛围也很好，我们觉得这和我们对他的支持理念有很大关系。 孩子被诊断不久，我和妻子就开始不断学习孤独症相关的干预方法。当时温州培训机会少，如果听到哪些地方有好的专家培训,我们都会尽量争取去参加,为此跑了深圳、上海好多地方。在这个过程中，我逐渐认识到，再多的方法，最后都离不开两个基础,那就是：爱与接纳。关键是我们如何看待障碍,如果我们忽视了孩子本身的需求而只看到障碍，那么对他和对父母来说,都会很艰难。现在，我们并不想改变他什么，只是想给他更合适的支持，去感受生命的不同与精彩。 \n星\n生命是多样的， \n感谢孩子给予了我们更有意义的人生。 \n作为同路人，我深知这一路的不易。这几年，特别感谢来自家人的理解和支持，我和妻子已成为“战友” 。同时，也要感谢孩子的小姨、外公外婆等众多家人的支持，他们的协助，让我们在工作和家庭之外，能够有更多的时间投入推动心智障碍者支持体系的完善。是孩子赋予了我们一段深刻的人生旅程。 \n生命是多样的，感谢孩子给予了我们更有意义的人生！ \n家庭支持中心绘画活动孤独症人士是天才吗？ 您可能从一些影视作品或媒体报道中看到一些孤独症人士具有很强的天赋，例如有超强的乐感、运算能力或记忆力等，这些都是孤独症中的一种高功能的类型，但他们的比例不到总数的万分之一。 \n通常，孤独症人士在多方面都会受到影响，因而表现出的轻重程度也非常不同。 \n受轻度影响的孤独症人士，比如阿斯伯格综合征或者高功能孤独症人群，在学业方面和自己擅长的领域比较出色，可是他们仍会经历社会交往困难。 \n受重度影响的孤独症人士，可能会有学习困难、注意力很难集中、刻板行为等等，他们对外界（他人和辅具）的支持需求更高。 \n来源：北京市残疾人联合会孤独症征兆一般出现在什么时期？ 孤独症儿童一般在3岁左右能被家长发现，其中2/3的患儿出生后逐渐出现孤独症征兆，约1/3的患儿经历了1-2年常态发育后出现倒退，并开始出现孤独症征兆。 \n3岁左右也是最佳的干预期，有研究表明，孤独症儿童在6岁前开始接受科学干预，比更大年龄才开始的效果明显得多。 \n综合国内外专家对父母的建议， \n如果孩子具有如上征兆，父母应尽早带孩子到专业医疗机构进行评估，然后及早开始相关的干预。如上内容只是作为参考，并不是说有这些征兆的孩子就是孤独症。 \n来源：北京市残疾人联合会“心智障碍者家庭支持计划”的愿景目标\n\n探索创新性、系统性解决方案，推动从家庭改变到社会改变。从小家到大家，促进心智障碍者家庭生活福祉构建和社会融入。聚水成川，点亮生命，让心智障碍者家庭不孤单、不绝望！ 别让确诊的漫漫长路耽误了孩子的黄金干预期有调查表明，我国孤独症儿童从初诊到确诊，大约要经历1年左右的时间，有些甚至更长。医生有时会对3岁左右的儿童诊断为“疑似” ，因此，一些父母为了求确诊、求心安，不惜花费几年时间，带孩子奔波在全国各大医院做诊断。 \n康复医学认为， 6岁以前是心智障碍儿童的黄金干预期，父母可以先尝试带孩子接受一些专业的、科学的早期教育和早期干预，不一定非要等到确诊才开始。 有可能是其他疾病吗？ 在儿童接受诊断时，一般专业人员会首先排除其他疾病，比如听力障碍、语言发育迟缓或身体方面的不适。听力障碍者对任何声音都没有反应，但孤独症人士会对非常喜欢、或让他们不适的声音做出回应；语言发育迟缓的儿童虽然会因为自身语言能力有限而对社交产生胆怯，但不会像孤独症儿童那样拒绝或逃避互动。 \n中国有句老话“贵人语迟” ，成为很多家长逃避孩子问题的一个借口。父母可以这样来看待诊断和干预：目前对于孤独症的诊断和干预是没有创伤性的，适当、适合的干预对儿童是有好处的。如果孩子真的是“贵人” ，那么当孩子开口讲话，并且各方面与同龄孩子表现相仿时，停止训练就可以了。但如果儿童确实有特殊教育的需要，那么早起步要比晚起步效果明显得多。 \n来源：北京市残疾人联合会\n2007年12月联合国大会通过决议，从2008年起，将每年的4月2日定为“世界提高孤独症意识日” ，以提高人们对孤独症和相关研究与诊断以及孤独症人士的关注，强调必须帮助改善孤独症人士的生活质量，这样他们才能作为社会的一个组成部分过上充实而有意义的生活。 \n\n来源：联合国， 2022 \n孤独症没有特效药物治疗，会伴随终身。早期诊断、干预，可以改善孤独症对个体的影响，提升个体的发展水平，因此孤独症干预一般认为是年龄越小开始、效果越好，但是并没有一个年龄的截止点，事实上很多孤独症人士因为得到了适合的、持续的支持，在较大年龄时依然可以获得改善。 \n世界各国尤其是发达国家建立了许多的孤独症特殊教育和训练课程体系，但各种方法兼有优缺点，尚无证据表明哪一种方法显著优于另外一种。各种方法有互相融合的趋势。 \n由于孤独症缺乏特效治疗，尚存在数以百种的另类疗法(alternative therapy) ，这些疗法缺乏循证医学证据，选择需慎重。

We conducted an online survey comprising items on demographic data; two self-designed questionnaires (children’s behavioral problems/psychological demand of parents during COVID-19); and four standardized questionnaires, including the General Health Questionnaire, Perceived Social Support, Parenting Stress Index, and Neuroticism Extraversion Openness Five Factor Inventory. The results showed that there were significant differences among parents of children with different challenges. Parents of children with autism spectrum disorder were more likely to have mental health problems compared to parents whose children had an intellectual disability or a visual or hearing impairment. Behavioral problems of children and psychological demands of parents were common factors predicting the mental health of all parents. Parent–child dysfunctional interactions and parenting distress were associated with parents of children with autism spectrum disorder. Family support, having a difficult child, and parenting distress were associated with having children with an intellectual disability. It is necessary to pay attention to the parents’ mental health, provide more social and family support, and reduce parenting pressures.Keywords: mental health, COVID-19, parents of different types of special needs children, parenting stress, perceived social support1. IntroductionSince the end of 2019, the severe acute respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has swept across the world. The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus pandemic as a public health emergency of international concern. Faced with such a critical situation, the Chinese government issued nationwide emergency policies in a short time, including shutting down schools and working places, home quarantine, and other public requirements to limit population mobility. Although these policies could effectively cut off the spread of the virus, these measures are associated with mental health problems, such as anxiety, self-reported stress, and disturbed sleep [1,2]. Many studies have reported the mental health status of medical staff and the general public; however, few have focused on more vulnerable groups such as children with disabilities (i.e., special needs children) and their parents.In China, there are millions of special needs children, but both them and their parents are still on the edge of social concern. As noted by studies, having a special needs child refers to a long-term challenges for parents, no matter what type and degree of disability the special needs children have [3]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the nationwide home quarantine that caused school and rehabilitation training institution closure required millions of children with disabilities to stay at home for months [4]. Some children with disabilities might experience behavioral regression and extensive problems because of their inability to access daily school education, rehabilitation training, personalized intervention, and treatments. Instead, parents have to undertake multiple tasks, including parenting, education, rehabilitation, and training, which could increase their parenting stress and cause mental health problems.According to previous studies, caring for special needs children causes many problems among parents on ordinary days; however, parents with special needs children experience more physical, social, and emotional challenges compared to parents of typically developing children [5]. They also face a greater risk of psychological burden and experience various mental health problems such as anxiety [4,6], depression [3], marital discord [7], and sleep problems [8]. Parents with differently challenged special needs children may display diverse types of mental health problems; however, anxiety and depression are the most common [6,9]. The anxiety and depression scores of parents of special needs children were significantly higher than those of typically developing children [9], whereas the rating of anxiety and depression were always moderately in agreement across parents and children [10,11]. Studies also suggested that parents of children with autism spectrum disorder almost always experience more mental health problems than the other forms of handicaps, such as intellectual disabilities [10,12].Prior studies have addressed some predicted factors among the mental health of parents of special needs children, such as economic and social status [13], unemployment [14], parenting stress [15,16], children’s behavior problems [17,18] and social support [19,20]. In general, parents of special needs children have to continually seek for more special treatment, medical equipment and other educational services, which more likely to lead to higher economic burden [21]. In the meantime, one of the parents should always be a main caregiver for the special needs child which may cause an overall decline in the family’s ability to work and reduce family income [22]. Therefore, parents of special needs children were always experience poverty because of lower economic and social status or unemployment as compared to their counterparts [9], which exacerbates mental health problems [22]. In addition, the serious behavioral and emotional problems of special needs children, and the pressure to raise such children were main challenge for parents [17,18,23]. Compared to typically developing children, special needs children are more likely to exhibit externalized behaviors, such as difficulties communicating, poor social relationships, and oppositional defiant disorder [24]. The range of serious behavioral problems continually strengthen the parental stress and trigger parents into a poor mental health cycle. Even the frequent regulatory problems of children, such as sleep problems, are also associated with worse mental health condition among parents [25]. It is noted that children’s behavior problems and parenting stress always occur together to predict the mental health of parents. Furthermore, other studies have reported that social support was an important factor for reducing parenting stress and promoting their ability to cope with mental health problems [19,20]. Unfortunately, parents of special needs children are often excluded from society and public concern, even though positive attitudes of raising special needs children among parents is always related to more social support [20]. These risk factors strengthen mental health problems among parents of special needs children.Based on the above research, we speculated that the mental health problems of parents of children with disabilities may be magnified during the COVID-19 pandemic. These parents may require mental health interventions through appropriate measures; therefore, it is necessary to comprehensively estimate these parents’ mental health status and the key predicting factors. According to reports conducted by the Chinese official institute [26], there are three main types of disabilities among children in China: autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disabilities, and visual or hearing impairments. This study focuses on the parents of three main types of disabilities among children.2. Methods2.1. Participants and Procedure2.1.1. ProcedureOwing to the home quarantine policy, the questionnaire survey was published on the internet. The online survey targeted the parents of special needs children in Guangdong Province in China and was conducted from 18 February to 22 February 2020. Participants were sampled by stratified random sampling method, recruited through special education schools and special education agencies in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Shaoguan, Dongguan, Foshan, Huizhou, and 21 other cities or regions. Parents could see this survey and answer the questionnaire by scanning the two-dimensional barcodes on their cellphones or clicking the relevant link of the questionnaire address on their computers. The questionnaire was anonymous to protect the participants, and it was completely voluntary and noncommercial. All the procedures involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the research ethics committee in the School of Education at Guangzhou University (Protocol Number: GZHU2020004).2.1.2. ParticipantsA total of 1898 responses were received, of which 1450 were valid (parents of children with autism, intellectual disability, or visual impairment and hearing impairment), with a valid rate of 76.40%. The average age of parents was 40.76 years (SD = 5.84), and there were 401 (27.66%) male participants (Mage = 43.23, SD = 5.98) and 1049 (72.34%) female participants (Mage = 39.82, SD = 5.50). According to the classification of special needs children by the China Disabled Persons’ Federation, a total of 454 (31.30%) parents’ children had autism spectrum disorder, with the average age of children being 11.38 years (SD = 3.34). There were 703 (48.50%) parents who had children with an intellectual disability, with the average child’s age of 12.51 years (SD = 3.17). A total of 293 (20.20%) parents had children with a visual or hearing impairment, with the average age of children being 12.47 years (SD = 3.45).2.2. Measures2.2.1. Demographic InformationDemographic information included sex, age, family monthly income, working state during COVID-19, and so on. Children’s information about gender, age and type of disability were also collected.2.2.2. Behavioral Problems of Children during COVID-19We employed a self-designed questionnaire to measure the behavioral problems of children with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire included 6 questions, and each question was scored based on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (no) to 4 (many). The exploratory factor analysis showed that the total KMO (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin) value was 0.75, and the Bartlett’s test of sphericity (χ2 = 2256.69, df = 15, p < 0.001), which indicated that principal component analysis of the data with Varimax rotation could proceed. Two factors were obtained: Factor 1 is named a regulatory problem (including unwillingness to wear mask, unwillingness to wash hands), of which the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.68. Factor 2 is named as an externalized problem (including asking to go out, sleep problems, eating problems, and mood swings), of which the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.74. Both factors accounted for 63.55% of the questionnaires. The Cronbach’s alpha of the whole scale was 0.76, indicating satisfactory internal consistency in all items. Overall, the confirmatory factor analysis of the questionnaire showed that the model fit well (χ2/df = 4.25, CFI (Comparative Fit Index) = 0.99, TLI (Tucker-Lewis Index) = 0.98, SRMR (Standard Root Mean-Square Residual) = 0.02, RMSEA (Root-Mean-Square Error of Approximation) = 0.05), indicating that the questionnaire was valid.2.2.3. Psychological Demand of Parents during COVID-19We employed a self-designed questionnaire to measure the psychological demand of parents of children with disabilities. The questionnaire included 10 questions. Each question was scored based on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (inconsistent) to 4 (consistent). The exploratory factor analysis showed that the total Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin value was 0.83, and the Bartlett’s test of sphericity (χ2 = 4516.19, df = 45, p < 0.001), which indicated that principal component analysis of the data with Varimax rotation could proceed. Two factors were obtained: Factor 1 was named as an emergency demand for COVID-19 pandemic, such as “I would hoard more supplies (like masks)”, “I would frequently confirm information about the pandemic”, of which the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.78. Factor 2 was named as demands for taking care of the child, such as “I have to deal with child’s behavioral problems”, “I need others to provide special equipment for my child with disabilities”, of which the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.78. These factors accounted for 56.52% of the questionnaires. The Cronbach’s alpha of the whole scale was 0.79, indicating satisfactory internal consistency in all items. Overall, the confirmatory factor analysis of the questionnaire showed that the model fit well (χ2/df = 3.89, Comparative fit Index = 0.98, Tucker-Lewis index = 0.97, Standard root mean-square residual = 0.02, Root -mean-square error of approximation = 0.04), indicating that the questionnaire was valid.2.2.4. General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12)The GHQ-12 is a mental health screening self-report that identifies whether participants have mental health problems and estimates the magnitude. It is valid, reliable, and utilized around the world [27]. The questionnaire included 12 items (6 positive and 6 negative questions), such as “I am able to concentrate when doing things” (positive), “I am in a happy mood” (positive), “I always feel stressed” (negative), and “I lose confidence” (negative). Each item was scored on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (less than usual) to 4 (much more than usual). We used a “0-0-1-1” scoring method (bimodal scoring method) to add all the scores [28,29]. Under GHQ scoring standard, the total score ≥3 indicated poor mental health of parents with special needs children [28]. In this study, the Cronbach’s alpha of this scale was 0.90.2.2.5. Perceived Social Support (PSS)The PSS is a questionnaire that assesses the magnitude of support. It consists of three subscales: Family Support, Friend Support, and Other Necessary Support [30]. Each item was scored based on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The Family Support Subscale included four items, such as “My family can actually help me”, “I can talk to my family about my problems”, etc. In this subscale, the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.92. The Friend Support Subscale included four items, such as “My friends can actually help me”, “I can talk to my friends about my problems”, etc. In this subscale, the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.92. The Other Necessary Support subscale included four items, such as “Some people (leaders, relatives, colleagues, etc.) will show up by my side when I have problems”, “I can share happiness and sadness with some people (leaders, relatives, colleagues, etc.)”, etc. In this subscale, the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.87. A total score was created by summing the three subscale scores, with higher scores indicating more perceived support. In this study, the Cronbach’s alpha of the PSS was 0.95.2.2.6. Parenting Stress Index-Short Form 15 (PSI-SF-15)The PSI-SF-15 is a questionnaire that measures parenting stress and burden. It consists of three subscales: parenting distress, parent–child dysfunctional interaction, and difficult child [31]. Each item was scored based on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The Parenting Distress Subscale included five items, such as “I cannot deal with new things”, “I feel like I can’t always do what I want to do”, etc. In this subscale, the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.85. The parent–child dysfunctional interaction subscale included five items, such as “My children seldom do anything that makes me feel more satisfied”, “I don’t think my children like me at most of time”, etc. In this subscale, the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.85. The Difficult Child Subscale included five items, such as “What my children do sometimes makes me angry”, “I feel that my child is very emotional and easy to worry”, etc. In this subscale, the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.90. A total score was created by summing the three subscale scores to indicate overall parenting stress. In this study, the Cronbach’s alpha of the PSI-SF-15 was 0.93.2.2.7. Neuroticism Extraversion Openness Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI)The NEO-FFI is a questionnaire that measures personality traits and comprises five subscales: Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness [32]. Each subscale includes 12 items, and every item was scored based on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strong disagreement) to 5 (strong agreement). Neuroticism examples include, “I’m not a worried person”, “I often feel inferior to others”, etc. Neuroticism is a variable highly related to mental health. Controlling neuroticism can better understand the mental health of parents during the pandemic. The total score of Neuroticism Subscales was created by summing 12 items. In this study, the Cronbach’s alpha of the NEO-FFI was 0.73.2.3. Data AnalysisSPSS version 26.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) and Mplus 8.3 were utilized to analyze the data. Firstly, Mplus 8.3 was used for confirmatory factor analysis to determine whether the structural validity of two self-designed questionnaires was reliable. Then, descriptive analyses were conducted to illustrate participants’ demographic information. A one-way analysis of variance was conducted to compare the mental health scores among the parents with three types of special needs children. Finally, Pearson’s correlation coefficients and hierarchical linear regression analyses were performed to analyze the factors predicting the mental health of different types of parents. The rationale for the order of the variables was the theoretical framework stated in the Introduction: economic and social status, unemployment, and other demographic variables would predict parents’ mental health, followed by parenting stress and social support.The parents with three types of special needs children were analyzed separately, and three hierarchical two-model multiple linear regression models were developed. Block One included demographic variables, such as sex, age, family monthly income, and working state during the COVID-19 pandemic. Neuroticism subscales were also used as a control variable in Block One. Block Two included behavioral problems of the children, psychological demand on the parents, parenting stress (including parenting distress, parent–child dysfunctional interactions, difficult child), and perceived social support (including family support, friend support, the other necessary support). To minimize the possible effects of multicollinearity, the independent variables and moderators were centered at their mean. A two-tailed test with p < 0.05 was considered significant.3. Results3.1. Parents Demographics and General Mental Health StatusTable 1 summarizes parents’ demographics. According to the GHQ-12 classic scoring criteria, a score over 3 indicated that parents’ mental health was poor. In this study, 1058 (73%) parents had good mental health and the remaining 392 (27%) had poor mental health.Table 1Demographic information about parents.VariablesParents of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (n = 454)Parents of Children with Intellectual Disability (n = 703)Parents of Children with Visual or Hearing Impairment (n = 293)\nn\n%\nn\n%\nn\n%Sex\n\n\n\n\n\nMale12427.3117224.4710535.84Female33072.6953175.5318864.16Family monthly income\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder CNY 5000 22048.4640056.9020770.65CNY 5000–9999 13629.9618726.605518.77CNY 10,000–14,999 5211.45588.25175.80CNY 15,000 and above4610.13588.25144.78Working state\n\n\n\n\n\nNormal rework10022.0315421.915719.45Home office8518.7210414.794314.68No work26959.2544563.3019365.87Mental health\n\n\n\n\n\nGood (GHQ < 3)31569.3851873.6822576.79Poor (GHQ ≥ 3)13930.6218526.326823.21Open in a separate windowAbbreviations: GHQ: General Health Questionnaire.A one-way analysis of variance was conducted to compare the mental health scores among the three types of parents with special needs children. A Kolmogorov–Smirnov test showed that the distribution of GHQ did conform to the normal distribution (p < 0.001). Combined with the P–P plots, the data distribution can be considered as a slightly positively skewed distribution [33]. As previous studies have reported, one-way analysis of variance can be used when the sample size is greater than 50 [34]. In this study, a total of 1450 individuals participated, therefore the one-way analysis of variance could be utilized. Levene’s test of homogeneity of variance showed that the variance of each group was not homogeneous (p < 0.001); Tamhane’s T2 was used to perform multiple comparisons.Overall, the results showed that there were significant differences in the mental health of parents with different types of special needs children (F (2, 1447) = 4.05, p = 0.02, η2 = 0.01). Parents of children with autism spectrum disorder were more likely to have mental health problems compared to parents of children with a visual or hearing impairment (p = 0.03). There were also marginal significant differences between parents of children with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities (p = 0.08). However, there was no significant difference between parents of children with an intellectual disability and those with a visual or hearing impairment (p = 0.66). Ranked by mean mental health scores, parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (M = 2.88, SD = 3.43) was first, followed by an intellectual disability (M = 2.45, SD = 3.25) and a visual or hearing impairment (M = 2.24, SD = 2.99). 3.2. Mental Health Status Among Parents of Children with Autism Spectrum DisorderPearson’s correlation coefficient analyses were performed to explore the factors related to parents’ mental health. The results showed that parents’ mental health was positively related to behavioral problems in children (r = 0.22, p < 0.001), psychological demand of parents (r = 0.31, p < 0.001), parenting distress (r = 0.38, p < 0.001), parent–child dysfunctional interaction (r = 0.36, p < 0.001), and difficult child (r = 0.27, p < 0.001); whereas it was negatively related to family support (r = −0.23, p < 0.001), friend support (r = −0.18, p < 0.001), and other necessary support (r = 0.22, p < 0.001).Hierarchical linear regression analyses were used to explore the factors predicting parents’ mental health, and parents’ mental health scores were the dependent variable (see Table 2). Demographic variables were entered in the first model as control variables, and the second model included behavioral problems of children, psychological demands of parents, parenting stress (including parenting distress, parent–child dysfunctional interactions, difficult child), and social support (including family support, friend support, and other necessary support). The maximum variance inflation (VIF) was 4.57, indicating that there was no multicollinearity between independent variables.Table 2Hierarchical linear regression analysis among parents of children with autism spectrum disorder.ModelsVariables\nB\n\nSE\n\nβ\n\nt\n95% CI\nR2\n\nF\nModel 1Age0.030.040.050.83−0.04, 0.10.1180.61 **Sex0.370.370.051.01−0.35, 1.09Family monthly income−0.520.16−0.15−3.29 **−0.83, −0.21Working state0.420.190.012.17 *0.04, 0.80(Child) Age−0.010.06−0.01−0.17−0.12, 0.10(Child) Sex−0.940.44−0.01−2.14 *−1.81, −0.08Neuroticism1.700.310.255.55 **1.10, 2.31Model 2Age0.010.030.020.34−0.06, 0.080.2410.54 **Sex0.260.340.030.76−0.41, 0.92Family monthly income−0.300.15−0.09−2.02 *−0.60, −0.01Working state0.270.180.071.51−0.08, 0.63(Child) Age0.050.050.051.04−0.05, 0.16(Child) Sex−0.610.41−0.06−1.48−1.42, 0.20Neuroticism0.800.310.122.59 **0.19, 1.40Behavioral problems (of children)0.570.260.102.25 *0.07, 1.07Psychological demand (of parents)1.070.320.163.31 **0.43, 1.70Family support−0.230.19−0.09−1.17−0.61, 0.15Friend support0.170.220.060.76−0.27, 0.60The other necessary support−0.320.24−0.12−1.33−0.78, 0.15Parenting distress0.530.230.142.33 *0.08, 0.98Parent–child dysfunctional interaction0.680.240.182.84 **0.21, 1.14Difficult child−0.240.19−0.08−1.25−0.63, 0.14Open in a separate windowNote: all the variables are centered at their mean. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.In the first model, family monthly income, working state during the COVID-19 pandemic, children’s sex, and neuroticism were the significant predictors of mental health, which accounted for 10.5% of the variance.

Mental Health Status Among Parents of Children with an Intellectual DisabilityPearson’s correlation coefficient analyses were performed to explore the factors related to parents’ mental health. The results showed that the mental health of parents of children with an intellectual disability was positively related to behavioral problems in children (r = 0.22, p < 0.001), psychological demand of parents (r = 0.26, p < 0.001), parenting distress (r = 0.28, p < 0.001), parent–child dysfunctional interaction (r = 0.27, p < 0.001), and difficult child (r = 0.26, p < 0.001); whereas it was negatively related to family support (r = −0.28, p < 0.001), friend support (r = −0.17, p < 0.001), and other necessary support (r = −0.15, p < 0.001).Hierarchical linear regression analyses were conducted to explore the factors predicting parents’ mental health, and parents’ mental health scores were the dependent variable (see Table 3).

DiscussionThis study found that 27% of parents with special needs children experienced mental health problems, which differed depending on the different types of disability in the children. Parents of children with autism spectrum disorder were more likely to have mental health problems compared to parents of children with an intellectual disability and a visual or hearing impairment, which is consistent with previous research [35,36].4.1. Similarities Between the Three Groups of Parents of Special Needs ChildrenFirstly, neuroticism was always significant in the three hierarchical linear regression models. As a control variable, neuroticism is a stable factor that impacts on mental health. To some extent, it could be used to control the impact of participants’ emotional state before the COVID-19 pandemic. The significant results concerning neuroticism confirmed that independent variables reported in this study could indeed be used to predict mental health among parents of special needs children during the COVID-19 pandemic.Secondly, behavioral problems of children were the main factors predicting mental health among parents. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the nationwide home quarantine prevented special needs children from not only accessing normal school education, but also rehabilitation training, personalized intervention, and treatments [37]. This may lead to behavioral regression and extensive problems in special needs children. In this study, the three groups of special needs children had regulatory problems (such as an unwillingness to wear masks and unwillingness to wash hands) and externalized problems (such as asking to go out and mood swings). Combined with previous studies, special needs children’s behavioral problems are always closely associated with parenting stress, and jointly predict the mental health among parents of special needs children. Finally, the psychological demand of parents also predicts mental health among all parents. On the one hand, most parents were similar to the general public, in that they would frequently confirm information about the pandemic and hoard more supplies (such as masks) [38]. Some studies have shown that such behaviors are normal, although it could also lead to the emergence of a poorer general mental health condition of parents of special needs children [1]. On the other hand, parents of special needs children need to continually seek out special treatment, medical equipment, and other services about how to deal with child’s behavior, which would increase their psychological burden. The pandemic would prevent parents from seeking solutions to deal with the behavioral problems among special needs children. 4.2. The Differences Between the Three Groups of Parents of Special Needs ChildrenPrevious studies have shown that the behavioral problems of special needs children are determined by the type and degree of the child’s disorder. Among the behavioral problems of autism disorders, the core issues include communication impairments and interference with restrictive behaviors [17]. In this study, we reported six behavioral problems in children, such as unwillingness to wear masks, unwillingness to wash hands, asking to go out, sleep problems, eating problems, and mood swings. These may be important manifestations of restrictive behaviors in children with autism during the COVID-19 pandemic. In normal times, children with autism may also experience tantrums, impatience, and anxiety because they cannot go outside or are not used to obeying the new rules (such as wearing a mask). However, at the same time, children with autism spectrum disorder are not good at communicating with parents and solving problems independently [39]. Consequently, parents have to exert more time and resources, which may increase more parenting stress. From this perspective, children’s behavioral problems are closely related to parenting pressure, and jointly predict mental health among parents. Furthermore, behavioral problems in children with autism are also associated with parent–child dysfunctional interactions among parents. Studies have shown that there is a two-way connection between parent–child relationships and behavioral problems in children [40]. This means that children’s behavioral problems could predict the tendency or change in the emotional quality of parent–child relationships. In other words, parents have to work harder during these parent–child interactions [41]. When repeated and restrictive behavioral problems are difficult to solve, parents tend to be more directive and control by employing verbal or corporal punishments, which decrease closeness and increase parent–child dysfunction [42]. Over time, this not only strengthens behavioral problems in children, but also results in increased mental health problems of parents.Among parents of children with an intellectual disability, behavioral problems were not only related to parenting distress, but also to difficult children. Compared with the restrictive behaviors of children with autism, children with an intellectual disability are mainly impaired in intellectual functioning and have poor performance in evidencing of impaired adaptive functioning, such as conceptual, social communication, and practical self-care domains [43]. Such children need more sustained, long-term, and repeated training, which could gradually improve their daily behavior. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, policies not only interrupted children from receiving rehabilitation treatment, but also increased their externalized problems in the absence of social activities, increased loneliness, and insufficient information [4]. Furthermore, frequent regulatory problems (such as sleep problems) are also common behavioral problems in children with intellectual disabilities, which usually affect parents’ mental health [44]. Therefore, it is reasonable that the difficulty of parenting and the distress of parenting were used to predict mental health among parents of children with an intellectual disability.In addition, parents of children with intellectual disabilities were good at seeking family support. It is interesting to note that family support was only significantly associated with mental health among parents of children with an intellectual disability, rather than the other types of parents. In China, the mode of caring for intellectual disabilities children still relies heavily on families [45]. The model is changing, however, and social support systems are gradually being constructed [19,20]. Based on this, the symptoms of special needs children are easily noticed by their parents, who can gather family strength and help children access special treatment and equipment. Family support becomes a protective factor for parents [19,20,46]. However, some studies have showed that parents of children with autism receive less family support, which may result in increased parenting distress, anxiety, depression, and poor mental health among parents [47]. The relationship between social support and mental health in the other types of parents is complex, and requires additional research.Among parents of children with a visual impairment, we found that neither parenting stress nor social support was significant; however children’s behavioral problems were still significant. Compared to other special needs children, children with a visual or hearing impairment were likely to have fewer behavioral problems. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, children with a visual or hearing impairment also displayed the six behavioral problems as mentioned above. Moreover, owing to their visual or hearing impairment, these children lag behind typically developing children in speaking, writing, attention, and executive functions [48]. Spoken language and writing skills play important roles in communication; visual attention, executive function, etc., are conducive to planning, problem solving, and the suppression of behavioral problems [49,50]. Therefore, children with a visual or hearing impairment have more behavioral problems, which would increase the psychological demand of parents compared to typically developing children. Overall, the mental health among such parents tended to be consistent with parents of typically developing children.4.3. Implications This study has two implications for the parents of special needs children. On the one hand, the results showed that 27% of parents had poor mental health during the pandemic. This suggests that we need to pay more attention to the mental health of parents of special needs children, especially parents of children with autism or intellectual disabilities. On the other hand, for all groups of parents, family support was critical to parents’ mental health; however, the parents of children with autism are receiving insufficient family support. This should be addressed to improve parents’ mental health.4.4. LimitationsThere are some limitations that should be considered when interpreting this study’s findings. Firstly, we examined three types of disabilities; thus, the results cannot be generalized to parents of other special needs children. Secondly, all of the outcomes were self-reported, which might lead to recall bias. However, using self-reported scales to measure mental health is common because of its convenience. To enhance the internal validity of the results, future research may use multiple measurement modalities for each variable. Thirdly, because an online questionnaire was used in the study, the computer literacy of respondents might have affected how they responded to the questionnaire. Additionally, we controlled neuroticism to better understand the mental health of parents during the pandemic. To increase the validity of the results, other variables can be added in future studies. Finally, because the data collection took place during the pandemic, without further data collection, we cannot know the long-term impact of discrimination amid the pandemic on the respondents’ psychological distress. Future studies can utilize random sampling strategies with multiple data collection in order to study the impact of discrimination over time.5. ConclusionsIn summary, some parents of special needs children had mental health problems during the pandemic. There were significant differences in the mental health of parents depending on the child’s disability. Overall, the behavioral problems of children and the psychological demands of parents were common factors predicting the mental health of all parents. Parent–child dysfunctional interactions and parenting distress were associated with parents of children with autism spectrum disorder. Family support, difficult child, and parenting distress were associated with parents of children with an intellectual disability. It is therefore necessary to provide more social and family support to reduce pressure on parents.AcknowledgmentsWe sincerely thank all the respondents for participating in this study.Author ContributionsThe study was designed by J.R. and S.-Q.C.

\n\n希望能将有关心智障得者的一些基本理念、知识、信息、建议呈现给读者。因时间与能力有限，手冊肯存在诸多不足， \n\n期待读者给予反馈意见， \n\n我们也将陆续完善、更新和补充这套手冊， \n\n期待可以为更多心智障得者家庭或相关人士提供力所能及的支持。 写在开头当您展开这本手册，您可能正在寻找一些对孩子和您都有用的信息。 \n这是《心智障碍者家庭支持资源手册-年龄系列》的第二册，从年龄角度出发，以心智障碍者进入儿童和少年期的主要经历为主线，向新手父母(或其他监护人)传递一些重要的观念、知识和建议尝试的做法。 \n如果您想更加系统地了解和支持孩子，我们推荐您同时阅读《心智障碍者家庭支持资源手册-总册》 (它会介绍什么是残障和心智障碍、什么是全生命周期发展等) ,以及《心智障碍者家庭支持资源手册-障别系列》中与您孩子情况相符的分册(其中包括《发育迟缓(智力障碍) 》 《孤独症》 《唐氏综合征》和《脑瘫》 4个分册) 。 \n7-15岁，人进入身心快速成长变化阶段，开始对自己和外界有了更多更广的探索，因此他们需要发展更多的校园融合技能、自主生活能力、个人兴趣和同伴关系，去扮演好自己、家人、学生和社区成员等不同角色。作为父母(或其他监护人) ，需要去了解这个阶段孩子的特点和可能遇到的各\n\n种问题和挑战，并去学习如何\n为孩子提供必要且适度的支持。 \n希望这本手册可以为您提供一些有用的信息。 写给正在此阶段的心智障碍者家庭心智障碍者家庭支持计划由深圳壹基金公益基金会和水滴公司旗下水滴公益平台于2019年6月共同发起，聚焦城市及欠发达地区支持心智障碍者家庭资源中心和家长联络站的建设，为心智障碍者及其家庭照料者开展信息提供、同伴支持、家长赋能、个性化支持和社区合作等服务，在全国和地方层面进行公众和政策倡导，促进社会认知改变。项目由北京晓更基金会·融合中国心智障碍者家长组织网络项目组负责实施。 \n截至2021年12月底，心智障碍者家庭支持计划覆盖25个市县，服务了53168人次心智障碍者和49918人次家长，并入选界面新闻“ 2021年度杰出慈善案例榜单” 。通过《家庭满意度调查问卷》显示： 95%以上的家长表示，资源中心的存在可减轻孤立无援的感觉，对子女有更加多元和深入的了解，可提升面对子女问题的能力，增加寻找解决问题的方法和资源。 \n本套《心智障碍者家庭资源手册》围绕“信息提供”这一资源中心最为基础的功能，系统筛选梳理了相关信息，期望能为迷茫期的心智障碍者家长，心智障碍者及家庭的服务提供者，以及任何希望了解和支持心智障碍者的相关方提供信息参考。 前言庭是每个人获得支持的最小社会单元。对于心智障碍者而言， \n\n他们的照料者是终生的陪伴者和支持者，只有有效地支持到家庭成员，才能够更好地促进从家庭到心智障碍者生活质量的提升。由中国精神残疾人及亲友协会编著的《中国孤独症家庭需求蓝皮书》显示： 95%的家长认为急需专业咨询及政策信息需求， 79.1%的家长认为在孩子的康复教育等方面没有获得专业化系统培训。 基于此背景，晓更基金会希望能通过这套资源手册，将有关心智障碍者的一些基本理念、知识、信息、建议等内容进行基础性的提炼汇总，各地心智障碍者家长组织或服务机构可以在本手册基础上，结合本地有关政策、服务资源、养育经验等内容进一步补充丰富，从而更好地帮助当地心智障碍者链接或获得专门化服务、主流化服务(如基本的健康、教育、就业等)以及获得主流化服务所需的辅助性服务或支持(如社区支持、家庭教育等) 。 北京市晓更助残基金会常务副秘书长\n\n梁志图机在是2023年，距离壹基金创始人李连杰先生参演的电影《海洋\n\n天堂》上映过去了13年，距离壹基金发起海洋天堂计划过去了11年。这个公益项目从关注孤独症群体到更大的心智障碍者人群，由“我”到“我们” ，从个人需求转化为公共议题，我们也一起见证了心智障碍者家长、家长组织、家长网络的成长和良性发展。我们同全国家长们一起从服务特殊需要人群，到组织和骨干能力建设，再到政策促进，以及公众环境教育。 从一生需求出发， 2019年6月，深圳壹基金公益基金会和水滴公司旗下水滴公益平台共同发起心智障碍者家庭支持计划，聚焦城市及欠发达地区支持心智障碍者家庭资源中心和家长联络站的建设，以街道、社区为单位，为各地心智障碍者及其家庭照料者开展信息提供、同伴支持、家长赋能、个性化支持和社区合作等服务，希望可以改善家长们孤立无援的处境，帮助家长们增强解决子女问题的方法和能力。 《心智障碍者家庭资源手册》属于该项目的一部分,期望能为迷茫期的您提供信息参考。 \n深圳壹基金公益基金会联合公益部主任\n任少鹏01 目录家庭和居住社区系统14家庭支持\n\n社区参与\n教育/社会系统随班就读的正确打开方式小升初准备\n\n如何度过初中青春期性教育\n\n预防校园欺凌03 \n22 \n04 \n05

\n横向代表贯穿人一生的生活广度，人生的主要发展阶段和大致估算年龄:成长期(约相当于儿童期) 、探索期(约相当于青春期) 、建立期(约相当于成人前期) 、维持期(约相当于中年期)以及衰退期(约相当于老年期) 。 纵向代表纵贯上下的生活空间,由人一生中必须扮演的九种主要身份角色组成，依次是：儿童、学生、休闲者、公民、工作者、夫妻、父母和退休者。各种角色之间是相互作用的，一个角色的成功，特别是早期的角色如果发展得较好，将会为其他角色提供良好的关系基础。但是，在一个角色上投入过多的精力，而没有平衡协调各角色的关系，则会导致其他角色的失败。在每一个阶段对每一个角色投入的程度用颜色来表示,颜色面积越多表示该角色投入的程度越多。 \n\"生涯彩虹图”符合一般人的普遍情况，虽然年龄段与角色的对应随着时代发展或个人情况会有些许变化，但大体与图示相符。根据国际残障领域专家研究发现，心智障碍者在成年之前与一般人的发展阶段和扮演角色基本一致,但在成年中期后，差异逐渐显著，他们的衰退期可能比一般人早20年。 \n(中国大百科全书, 2022) 01 \n此图由内向外所示，以心智障碍者为中心，围绕他/她们的环境中可分为四类系统：家庭和社区系统、教育/社会系统、政策福利系统和医疗健康系统。根据“生涯彩虹图” ，对应这四个系统，心智障碍者在这个年龄段会扮演不同的身份角色。最外圈则是心智障碍者为扮演好每个身份角色，所需要的支持资源。本手册内容框架正是以这四个系统及对应的支持资源来展示。 家庭和居住社区系统\n7-15岁的心智障碍者需求\n接受义务教育，并需要一个过渡期接受教育是儿童的权利，无论是在普通小学里随班就读，还是到特殊教育学校上学。进入小学，意味着儿童第一次走进了有约束性管理要求的、社会化的集体环境，在学校这个规范化且相对标准化教育的环境中，所有儿童都需要经历过渡期，心智障碍儿童面临的挑战以及在过渡方面所需的时间,可能比其他同龄人更多。 掌握校园自主融合技能心智障碍儿童在校园环境中常面临不同的困难与挑战，普通教育背景下教师可能缺乏必要的精力、时间和经验去帮助心智障碍学生，而父母也由于缺乏掌握相应的方式、方法，难以为孩子提供有效的技能辅导和支持。 \n如果心智障碍儿童可以扎实掌握一些技能，例如，校园生活自理，校园融合沟通，一些不易被直接观察到的基础能力:例如一起做操、背诵、做值日，抄写以及完成作业等,这可以帮助他们展现出已具备的知识能力，促进他们学习新的知识、技能，进一步适应学校统一的测评指标。 做好体能上的准备学习是上学阶段的主导活动，儿童需要有好的精力投入学校的学习与生活。 学习自主生活能力生活永远是第一位的，自主生活是每一个儿童青少年的需要，心智障碍者也不例外。他们需要有机会为自己的生活做出选择、决定并承担责任，如：自己选择每日穿着的衣物、自己选择用什么活动打发休闲时间、学习自主购物、决定自己房间的布置陈设、承担力所能及的家务等，同时获得不同的生活体验，以提升他们自主选择和自主生活的能力。 \n入学后的家庭端支持规划父母要有一个相对理性平和的心态， \n做好充分的思想准备和行动规划父母需要对自己有一个相对准确的定位，虽然需要考虑的事、即将面临的挑战有很多，但不要让自己处于焦虑中。可以和有经验的家长事先取经学习，了解孩子上学阶段会遇到的挑战和应对策略。 家庭内部分工与家庭环境的准备围绕孩子的入学成长目标，家庭主要照顾者要有明确的责任分工和一些协作原则，有利于家庭成员的彼此支持和共同分担。在清晰的家庭分工下，有利于孩子基于相对-致的安排和要求R形成J惯规ี .例如:谁负责孩子出勤接送;谁负责与老师的沟通;谁负责孩子的课业支持;如果家庭聘请了特教助理，谁负责与特教助理订立支持计划、做定期的沟通;谁负责孩子课外的休闲娱乐及辅助的康复等。 \n合理分类并安排好孩子上学所需的物品，保证安全和舒适的家庭环境。 2.入学准备的居家训练根据《心智障碍者家庭支持资源手册-年龄系列之0-6岁婴幼儿期》中所提到幼小街接的各种准备，在家帮子女进行有针对性的入学能力准备的居家训练，例如建立与学校作息相一致的居家作息，继续培养生活自理能力，在做家务的过程中练习整理和做卫生等。 3.成长目标的设定基于入学后的潜在变化，父母可以和子女一起设定入学成长目标，不同的心智障碍者能够参与这件事的程度不同，家庭可根据实际情况，尽可能为子女提供自主表达或选择的机会，哪怕是很小的一部分，也要传达给子女一个信息：就是上学这件事与他/她自己息息相关，他她要全程参与\n目标需要符合心智障碍者的实际情况,避免过高或过低的期待。父母不能拿自己的子女与别人家孩子比较，同时对于障碍程度重的子女，也不能对抱着“没要求，只要在学校待着就行”的放任态度。 \n入学后心智障碍者遇到的实际问题会让目标变得更加清晰、具体,父母可以和子女一起来动态微调目标，让子女经过努力就有机会达到，从中获得成就感，然后去保持或向更高的目标迈进。 \n这些目标可以从多维度设定，包括:出勤目标、课程常规目标、课业目标及其他相关目标;设立几个检视目标实现情况的阶段，第一周、第一个月和第一个学期希望实现的状态和实现后的庆祝方式。例如： 与孩子共同制定目标1.召开家庭会议建议组织一个家庭会议，邀请孩子与家庭中承担主要照护责任的人都来参加，为孩子上学做一个小小的仪式性的庆祝。把上学后相比当前的生活安排所需做出的一些调整和变化,在家庭内部明确共识。为孩子进行一些心理建设，用积极正面的语言给孩子讲解上学的好处。 \n自主生活能力培养学习独处低年级学生要学会自己独立睡觉，到了高年级要学会自己独立上下学、保管钥匙、独立居家，从半天到一整天，逐步培养出独处能力，让心智障碍者学会安排自己的时间。 学习独立出行从自己走路回家开始，反复练习过马路、搭乘公共交通工具等。父母对心智障碍子女的支持，需要根据掌握这项技能的情况而逐步减退，例如从最开始的陪同，到尾随确保安全，然后放手子女短途独立出行，到最后完全独立出行。父母一定要在最初做好风险预案,当遇到问题时，可以及时做出因应处理。 自己掌握零用钱心智障碍者与普遍同龄人一样，需要有一些能自主决策使用的零用钱，父母可以鼓励子女学会记账、延迟满足消费欲望。 学做基本家务心智障碍者是家庭中的一员，而不只是受照顾的对象，所以也要承担自身能力范围内的家务劳动，如扫地、拖地、擦桌子、洗碗等，参与家务劳动不仅能培养孩子对家庭的责任感，也能锻炼他们的动手能力和专注力。 父母的支持【扩展阅读】 \n\n该节内容出自由北京融爱融乐心智障碍者家庭支持中心编写的《我的校园我做主》 ，此处只做简单介绍，详情请阅读原书。 \n(内容来自卢莹女士的经验分享) 培养兴趣不仅为了陶冶情操、发展特长，这也是心智障碍者打发休闲时光的积极方式，所以需要为心智障碍者提供尽可能多的机会，去尝试不同的休闲方式，发掘他们的兴趣，如:各种体育运动、演奏乐器、绘画、手工制作/拼装、阅读(字或图画)等等。尤其对于障碍程度较重的心智障碍者，学会自己打发休闲时光非常重要，让他们的生活能够充实、有想做的事，并从中获得满足感和对生活的掌控感。 发展个人兴趣，获取成功经验\n培养兴趣、学会休闲\n拥有同龄人普遍的常态生活心智障碍者需要有机会使用典型青少年的用品,如:手机、网络的运用。与其他普通青少年有相似的经验，有利于促进他们与同龄人的交往，有更多共同语言。当然，照顾者也需要和他们达成共识或建立行为规则,适度使用手机/网络,避免过度沉迷,影响视力和生活规律。 保持运动习惯随着心智障碍者进入学校，他们的生活半径也会产生变化。为了帮助心智障碍者适应新的环境，照护者既要有效借助旧的生活圈帮助他们调剂减压，也要逐步开发新的资源来建设校外支持圈,例如: 熟悉的亲友圈以前经常团聚的亲友小圈子，周末等时间还是可以继续聚一聚，让心智障碍者有机会处在熟悉的人和活动中，这样他们感受到的变化就不是全然一新的，对照护者而言也算是一种暂时的喘息。 与从前的老师、康复师保持联系父母可以与心智障碍子女以前所在康复机构、幼儿园的老师继续保持沟通，在子女面临一些不适应或出现问题的时候，积极获得他们的建议。 建立社区中的自然支持小区和学校的保安、上学需要搭乘的公共交通工具(公交车或校车) 、课后生活安排的一些空间和支持人员— —这些相关方都可以成为潜在资源，从安全、适应性方面给予自然而然的支持。 建立小区同伴友谊小学阶段的儿童已经具备对友谊的想法和需求，父母可以在小区甚至周边社区内帮子女逐步建立良好的同伴友谊和同伴支持。例如:可以经常跟住在同一小区的同学核对作业记录是否完整；遇到生病请假的情况，可以互相帮忙代领作业本等等。 02 \n教育/社会系统在儿童和少年时期,教育/社会系统的大部分重心处于教育领域。心智障碍者无论进入普校随班就读，还是在特殊教育学校学习，都需要得到适合他们本人的支持。其中，在普通学校进行随班就读所面临的挑战可能更多，所以此处进行着重介绍。 普通学校随班就读的正确打开方式о 根据《残疾人教育条例》以及《关于加强残疾儿童少年义务教育阶段随班就读工作的指导意见》 (以下简称“随班就读指导意见” ) ，以下是普通学校实施以随班就读为形式的融合教育的核心要素。 \n评估\nو • • • و \n1.学校应该组织班主任、学校的特殊教育资源教师、父母，并在有条件的情况下聘用康复专业人士共同参与学生评估。评估是为儿童入学后的支持计划做准备，而不是作为儿童入学的依据。因此，父母可以咨询或邀请学校进行这样的评估沟通，即使不是十分正式,但如果有一个这样的交流会议，对综合规划后续支持将非常有意义。 \n2.通过评估来规划对学生的支持，主要是基于学生的学习能力状况、学校的环境支持情况与课业标准来对照。原则上，如果在学校办理了随班就读，学校就需要为这名学生建立个别化教育档案。 \n3.从家庭角度来看，评估应该是双向的，一方面是基于对儿童的评估，另一方面也要评估学校的支持能力和资源，由此找到可以支持儿童成长学习、满足学校要求的最佳方案。 制定个别教育计划(IEP) ，落实“一人一案” 1.上述《随班就读指导意见》规定“普通学校要针对残疾学生的特性，制订个别化教育教学方案,落实\"一人一案” ,努力为每名学生提供适合的教育” \n2.上述“一人一案”提出学校要结合优势视角，综合关注学生的发展，除了文化课，更要关注开发潜能、补偿缺陷,特别是要加强行为规范教育、公共安全教育、生活适应教育、劳动技能教育、心理健康教育和体育艺术教育，帮助学生提高自主生活质量和劳动能力,培养正确的生活、劳动观念和基本职业素养，为适应社会生活及就业创业奠定基础。因此,即使心智障碍者在文化学科遇到挑战,父母也要充分利用学校内其他学习资源，如:文体艺术、社会实践、德育劳动等，促进子女的参与、融入和学习。 \n3.根据“最小限制、最小隔离、最大融合”的原则，为了更好地支持心智障碍者的学习，有条件的地方，一人一案的落实涉及到“抽离式”支持方案— —即需要从学生所在班级抽离学生到资源教室或其他环境中的特别支持。抽离的目的是为了学生更好地融入、收获和成长: \n促进发展，弥补不足，如：动作发展、思维训练等；情绪和行为问题干预，如：孩子的哭闹问题；缩小落差，如：进行某学科的补救教学； \n\n提升学习质量，如：某个学习方法、学习习惯的培养。 \n(北京融爱融乐2019年融合教育交流沙龙-朱振云老师分享摘要) 父母与班主任、资源教师及特教助理的协作关系班主任应该是儿童在学校学习生活的第一负责人，因此父母需要积极和班主任建立信任的合作关系，提升班主任的意识，使其接纳心智障碍者是班级中平等的一员、同样应该得到班主任提供的必要支持；同时父母也要做好班主任的后盾，当班主任遇到无法解决的情况，家长需要及时提供有效的支持。 资源教师应该扮演协调校内外支持资源的统筹角色,资源教师应该参加到学生的定期评估沟通工作中，根据支持方案协调其他相关资源来支持学生和老师的特别需求。对于这些个别化支持安排是否充足到位，家长可以与资源教师进行沟通协商特教助理(也称影子老师) 作用是提供辅助支持，协助班主任和任课老师正常教学，协助个案学生在校园内的学习生活。父母应该针对心智障碍子女的学校表现和支持方案，与特教助理保持密切的沟通。 营造接纳、友爱的班级氛围开发校园内的自然支持\n老师需要有意识地营造团结友爱、彼此尊重、相互支持的班级文化，也可以挖掘一些友善、耐心、性格积极阳光的同学，成为心智障碍者的固定支持者。例如，在一些小学里，班主任会为特需儿童选择几位“学习同伴” ，除了在学校中提供支持，偶尔也会在周末轮流去特需儿童家中陪伴学习或游戏。 同学成为心智障碍者的学习伙伴,发挥引导、提醒、陪伴等积极作用,支持心智障碍者更好地适应和融入课堂学习与校园生活。 父母如果有适合的机会，可以与班里其他有共同价值观的父母建立联系，通过组织一些吸引同班同学的小活动帮助心智障碍者建立同伴支持圈，同伴支持对于帮助心智障碍者融入校园、预防校园欺凌至关重要。例如，举办主题班会课，向全班同学介绍心智障碍者的特殊情况，并加以德育教育引导，鼓励同学们互助互爱，学会与不一样的人相处；设立班级乐于助人奖，与三好学生一样在期末评奖，记录成长手册，奖励正向行为，营造正向班风。 校外公益组织例如由心智障碍者家长组织提供支持，进入学校开展融合校园文化建设活动，已在全国多地开展过“友爱校园行项目” ，倡导不一样的生命形态，营造校园友爱氛围。 【补充信息】 友爱校园行项目由北京市晓更助残基金会融合中国公益项目于2016年发起，旨在通过与各地有特需儿童随班就读的普通中小学合作，立足特需儿童所在班级，开展以儿童为主导的、多元生动的融合德育课程及倡导实践活动，同时支持学校提升教职人员的融合教育理念及实施能力，从而营造友好校园文化环境，搭建儿童伙伴关系，促进特需儿童充分融入校园以及所有儿童的身心成长，让所有儿童一起上学、同班、同学。 \n扫码下载友爱校园行工具包父母如何与学校建立积极有效的沟通入门指南父母的角色是独一无二的，没有人比父母更加了解和爱护自己的孩子。每一位父母都是教育自己孩子的专家，虽然父母不可能知道所有问题的答案，但是每位父母都希望自己的孩子在学校和生活中能取得成功，作为父母的热情有助于实现出色的沟通。 开学前向学校写一封信向班主任和科任老师们介绍自己孩子的情况，诚恳不隐瞒，让老师们知道您是重视孩子家庭教育、愿意积极配合老师、愿意为孩子付出爱与责任的父母。 与孩子的学校交流时，父母请留意自己的情绪状态即使学校没有提供有效的支持，父母也切忌让学校过去(或现在)的问题、您内心的忧虑和其它负面情绪充斥着脑海。请保持冷静，关注正面心态，将注意力集中到让孩子进入普校上学的目标上，并相信学校愿意竭尽所能帮助每一位孩子。 明确目标，确定优先顺序并制定计划需要为孩子完成的最重要的事情是什么？请列出一个清单，记下涉及的争端、问题和可能的解决方案。然后为这些项目排序，决定哪些问题必须解决，哪些项目可以忽略。 积极倾听并理解他人的观点，提出问题并阐明您的观点在遇到问题,要为孩子寻求满意的解决方案时，请相信学校有意愿和家长一起面对和解决问题，只是学校对情况的了解不足以及资源不足。父母需要先了解学校的困难，并积极给予建议、一起探讨解决方案。 先准备好解决问题的若干选项，根据需要加以提出，以供讨论父母相对于学校是处在有利地位的，面对出现的各种问题，作为父母对孩子的了解和用心，可能会想到一些学校想不到的替代方案。 积极反馈，正向激励父母在关注自己孩子的同时，希望也能表明已经意识到学校有满足每个孩子需求的意愿与需要克服的困难，这能使学校更愿意为您的孩子付出额外努力，并以更具创意的方式考虑如何做出肯定回答。 \n同时,父母需要花心思长期建设关系,愿意投入时间对微小的改变做出表彰和感谢,肯定学校和老师的付出与支持等。例如，每学年结束前写一封感谢信，列举过去这一年孩子在校领导/老师/同学]的帮助下获得的进步和成长小故事,表达感谢之情,并抄送给区教育局；孩子毕业前订制感谢锦旗，在毕业典礼上赠送给学校。 \n(CADRE, 2008;卢莹女士的经验分享) 概述小升初准备。 و و 准备时间最晚在小学的最后一学期，应完成小升初的转衔计划制订。 参与人员学生及其父母、中学老师,视学生需要有必要参与的相关专业人员，如职业治疗师等，理想而言，学生的小学班主任等相关人员也要参与其中。 转衔计划内容评估目前学生的能力水平,根据评估结果制定:如何选择学校、进入初中后的目标与支持方案。 \n了解政策\n初中学业难度增加,很多心智障碍者升入初中靠的是政策支持，不是靠自身的知识水平，所以父母非常需要了解相关政策。 尽量完成九年义务教育有小学学籍的学生都可以升入初中，学籍顺延。小学毕业没有毕业证书，所有初中毕业生都能获得义务教育毕业证书。有些父母想象初中有更多困难和挑战，不想让心智障碍子女继续就读。然而初中是一个全新的环境，无论如何要让心智障碍者尝试一下，如果能遇到好的老师和同学，他们就能完成九年义务教育，拿到毕业证书。如果没有九年义务教育文凭，对未来就读职业教育学校也会有影响。如果实在读不下去，可以再想其他办法。 了解升学照顾性政策各地随班就读政策不同,有些地区只有小学可以申请随班就读;有些地区小学办理的随班就读可以顺延到初中，初一初二还可以继续申请。注意了解关于特需学生的升学照顾性政策，例如，学片内的特教班、资源教室、驻校社工站，还有合理便利原则等(详见下文说明) . \n选择目标学校\n1 \n跟随电脑派位\n2 \n如果有机会择校\n尽可能选择选择离家近、 \n公共交通方便、学片内有融合教育\n资源支持的学校就读(例如， \n有资源教室或驻校社工\n支持) 、随班就读\n口碑好的学校。 \n3 \n转学到特殊教育学校\n需要学生有残疾证；当地特殊\n教育学校的7-9年级有富余\n的学位可提供；当地教育政策\n的执行情况许。 \n4 \n转学到学片内的普校特教班\n有些地区普通学校的特教班是九年制， \n在这所学校读书的特需学生可以直接\n升入本校初中；有些没有特教班的学校， \n特需学生六年级毕业后，有机会申请\n升入同一学片内有特教班的\n学校读7-9年级。 \n5 \n参加各种特长生考试\n有特长的特需学生，例如艺术、 \n体育，如果去参加特长生考试， \n也有机会进行择校。 \n6 \n直升对口初中\n特需学生父母需要去了解片区内有哪些初中，这些学校的融合教育经验如何，以前就读的特需学生可以得到什么样的支持， \n\n学校的融合教育态度如何等。 \n做好家校沟通可申请合理便利安排学位的情况如果特需学生伴有肢体或视力障碍,可尝试向区教育局申请合理便利,就近就便安排学位。但如果只是有智力障碍或孤独症的学生，很可能没有这方面支持。 通过小学校长转介联系初中校长学校一般情况下在意父母多过于学生本身，意思是学校接收一位特需学生，更在意父母是否好说话、配合学校工作。如果父母在小学里的口碑不错，可以通过小学校长联系到初中校长,小学校长也会将家长积极、配合的态度转达给初中校长，请记住：校长之间的一句话胜过父母一万句(一定记得小学毕业时写感谢信、送锦旗给学校，办法很土，但很有用) 约见初中校长面谈交底，争取分到好的班主任，与小学同学同班心智障碍者读到初中,一般很难再继续“潜伏” (即父母不对老师透露心智障碍者的情况,而是跟班混读) ，所以需要父母提前跟校长交底，然后通过校长选择好的班主任。如果不确定能否升入心仪的学校，有的父母会去找到心仪初中的校长沟通，接纳程度高的学校会很看重父母的态度，得到校长认可后，孩子先去参加电脑派位，如果派不到这所学校，再去选择“择校” ，只要和这所学校的校长讲好，届时批准入读即可，但需要交一定金额的择校费。 通过班主任与同班同学沟通，安排比较好的小组同学父母需要先和班主任谈好,再由班主任再去跟班里的学生沟通,去安排比较友善的同学跟特需学生为一组。 关于初中军训，有如下几种选择有的特需学生障碍程度较轻，可申请一同去参加军训，尽管会遇到很多挑战，但可以通过自己的努力或在陪读老师的支持下坚持完成军训。 \n有的父母尽管不确定孩子能否应对军训这个挑战，但想尽可能给孩子一个尝试的机会,哪怕中途退出,也算是努力过。 \n有的父母则是直接放弃，学校一般会同意,因为带特需学生去军训这件事对学校同样是挑战。 \n(内容来自卢莹女士的经验分享) 制定三年目标\n初中可能是大多数心智障碍者求学过程中最辛苦的三年，学业跟不上，和新同学很难建立友谊…但在初中阶段，父母要和孩子提前设定三年目标，即希望孩子三年后以什么样的状态从初中毕业，走向高中或职业高中。 \n学业成绩在全市50%以上的学生，可以设定上普通高中的目标\n上普通高中很难，全国各地对所有学生的普高录取率也就是50% 。如果清晰定位要上普高，那么就要努力保持成绩在全市50%以上。 能参加普通中考的，可以设定上职业高中的目标\n中考是人生的里程碑建议能参加中考的就尽量去参加。因为中考是九年义务教育的句号，是心智障碍者人生的一个里程碑、一个重要的仪式，如果没有参加中考，这将是他们人生的一个遗憾。只需要经历过程，不强求结果。 父母如何与学校沟通，为孩子争取参加中考的机会并不是所有学校都愿意随班就读的学生去参加中考，因为有可能拉低平均分。曾有老家长和学校这样沟通：这些孩子(心智障碍者)未来很可能不会去参加高考，不一定能找到工作，也可能不会结婚生子，这些其他人生命中一个又一个里程碑，他们不一定都能经历。现在中考是他们人生中唯一一个有可能与同龄人一起去参与的重要事件，但凡有这个机会，希望他们不要错过。 以中考为目标需要满足的条件如果目标是参加中考，那么就要考虑这个行为需要满足什么条件，例如，要具有应考的行为、熟悉考试的常规，要知道考试是如何进行的，形成行为习惯… …所以在初中三年，尽可能让心智障碍学生去参加大大小小各种考试、测验、一模二模、体育考试、英语听力… …成绩不重要，而是去熟悉考试流程、常规、考场要求。让他们能安坐，按照规定时间填写卷子，不能随便离场，无论题会不会答，都要写满，哪怕是蒙、提前背样题也没关系。 不参加中考，也可以上职业高中学习知识跟考试成绩没有必然关系，考试成绩跟升学也没有必然关系。没有参加中考的心智障碍者也有上职业高中的机会。如果没有合适的职业高中，民办职业训练机构也是可以考虑的资源。 特殊教育学校职高班特殊教育学校也是择优录取，除了心智障碍者自己去考学，也要看各校的招生政策，并不是障碍程度重的学生就不能上职高。例如，一些一线城市的特殊教育学校，只要是本校初中毕业的学生，都可以升到本校的职高，不会区分学生个人的能力，哪怕是障碍程度重的学生,学校也都招收。这样三年之后,学生就能取得职业高中教育文凭。 \n设定三年计划\n制定好初中三年的目标之后，就要来设定初中三年的计划。不仅要平稳度过，更期待有更多的发展，让心智障碍者能够适应初中学习生活、探索继续学习的机会、融入社区和社会。 适合心智障碍者的学业计划合理作息,生活充实:制定适合心智障碍者的学业计划,安排好合理作息,以生活充实有规律为目标。 \n主科尽量跟随：尽管可能跟不上进度，但不要放弃所有学科的学业，语数英还是要辅导，否则心智障碍者在学校没事做，会出现很多问题。 \n选择走读/校外租房:老家长建议没有午睡习惯的心智障碍者，尽可能在中午时间离开学校,例如在学校附近租房或找托管中心,可以让本人和老师都放松一下。 \n培养心智障碍者良好的学习态度和学习习惯:上课做笔记，课后做作业，完成考试和测验。可以跟老师去谈，减少作业量，但不能不写，这是态度问题。不能理解的内容可以不去看，但背课文、背单词是可以的，让心智障碍者感觉很充实，但压力也不会太大。 发展优势能力，奠定未来职业发展方向发展优势能力:比如喜欢画画、演奏乐器的心智障碍者,可以尝试去发展这方面的特长。如果没有特长，哪怕只是喜欢吃，也可以向烹饪专业去发展\n参加社会实践:可以利用寒暑假寻找机会让心智障碍者参加社会实践/实习,积累经验。 \n与同龄人交往，特需学生之间的友谊发展\n\n初中是全新的环境,心智障碍者跟新同学很难交朋友。但是同校的其他特需学生，可能会在做抽离课程或参加活动时成为朋友。 \n\n在校外还可以积极参加社群活动，培养和发展特需青少年之间的友谊。 \n理解性教育关注性教育性教育有着广泛的含义，认识自己的身体、保护身体隐私、掌握恰当的社交方式、了解社交规则等等，都是性教育的重要内容。很多家庭认为孩子还小，不适合进行性教育,其实性教育需要从幼儿园阶段就开始,不能等到青春期阶段或者遇到问题才开始关注。 尽早提供适当的引导举个例子， 14岁的小明是一位心智障碍少年，他对女性的丝袜特别感兴趣，在公共场合会一直盯着女性的腿看，甚至忍不住伸手去摸，这样的行为显然不符合社交规则， \n也让小明自己面临安全隐患(被认为是性骚扰) 社会适应能力发展\n\n比如独处、外出、购物、点餐、理财、家务、志愿服务等。 \n其实，对异性感兴趣是青春期阶段的正常现象，说明小明的身心处于发展常态，这是值得高兴的事情，父母不应该因为孩子在青春期的一些懵懂的想法和行为感到羞耻而责骂孩子。然而有些父母不认为自己孩子的行为不当，反而要求别人必须理解和尊重，不能责怪他们。事实上，很多不当行为并不是心智障碍者的本质障碍,而是教育和引导不及时造成的。 \n把孩子的感受放在第一位，追求平静稳定的情绪和心态如果实在无法在学校待下去，即使休学，学籍也一定要维持下去。 \n(内容来自卢莹女士的经验分享) 青春期少年的需求及亲子关系\n青春期少年的需求青春期是成年前的准备，这个阶段的青少年本质上是非常脆弱敏感、自我为中心的。处于这一阶段的青少年很努力地在适应身体的各种变化，控制自己冲动的情绪，还要学会更多的社交技巧。他们很少能够确信自己可以被同伴或者是同龄人所接受，所以非常需要确认自己是有价值的，获得鼓励，提高自信。 亲子关系青春期阶段的亲子关系问题是很多父母遇到的挑战。这个时期，孩子跟父母的关系常常会很紧张、甚至产生冲突，虽然不是每个孩子都会如此，但是大部分孩子在青春期阶段，因为受荷尔蒙的影响，会产生一些情绪的问题。冲突意味着孩子独立需求的出现，他们一方面仍然一如既往地依赖于父母的支持，另一方面又想要有更多的独立性，所以这个阶段，父母要去理解孩子的变化并学习调整跟孩子的关系。 \n对于青春期阶段的孩子,父母需要有智慧地去应对,跟他们“斗智斗勇” ,在性教育里让孩子懂得建立责任感，让孩子知道做的事情是有后果的，他们要有承担后果的能力。 \n(融爱融乐, 2020) \n父母学习： 《性知家长(胡敏婷老师系列分享) 》 什么是校园欺凌？ 预防校园欺凌0 \n校园欺凌是全球性的问题\n国外研究表明初中阶段情绪行为障得儿童受欺凌的比例最高，达到71.8% 。 国外研究表明特需儿童遭受校园欺凌的概率是普通儿童的2-3倍，特别是初中阶段情绪行为障碍儿童受欺凌的比例最高，达到71.8% 。在不同障碍类型的学生中,孤独症儿童被认为是最容易遭受欺凌的。 定义国际定义:校园欺凌问题研究之父—挪威心理学家奥维尤斯(Olweus,D)认为，校园欺凌指受害者被一名或多名学生故意地、反复地、持续地做出负面行为，对受害者造成身体和心理上地伤害或不适应。分类:关系欺凌、言语欺凌、身体欺凌等，近年出现网络欺凌。 1 \n我国定义:我国新修订的《未成年人保护法》第130条首次从法律上定义了“学生欺凌” ,明确了学生欺凌是指发生在学生之间，一方蓄意或者恶意通过肢体、语言及网络等手段实施欺压、侮辱，造成另一方人身伤害、财产损失或者精神损害的行为。 应对措施目前的研究资料显示，应对校园欺凌的措施主要涉及三个方面：一是校园外部环境的建设，包括改善社会外部环境、健全法制；二是校园内部的建设，建立防治校园欺凌的校园管理机制,积极疏导,创造和谐环境;三是教授被欺凌者具体的自我保护技能。在实际案例中,要区分学生欺凌与学生间打闹嬉戏的界定,正确合理处理。 校园欺凌的形式\n特需学生更容易受到隐匿的欺凌澳大利亚库克大学的Dianne L.Byers等人(2011)指出，老师一般重视和严肃对待公开性的欺凌行为，而不少校园欺凌行为隐秘性导致其不易被发现。 2特殊需要学生也是如此，受其认知理解能力和社交能力的限制，更容易受到隐匿的欺凌，且无法准确描述情况。他们更容易在隐蔽场所受孤立、受到言语欺凌和身体欺凌。例如在教室里老师不在场的情况下，老师转身在黑板写字的时候，或在厕所。 这些欺凌行为包括但不限于接触身体和不接触身体两种类型，接触身体的欺凌行为，例如突然伸脚绊特需生，特需生无法判断是谁绊倒自己，甚至自己是怎么摔倒的可能都说不清楚;站队时，特需生不知道自己该站在哪里，当试图加入队伍时，有些同学会推开他说： “你不是站在这里的。 ”还有极少量非常严重的欺凌行为，例如扇耳光，在厕所里被扔厕纸或者关在厕所里，虽然极少，但会发生，影响非常恶劣。不接触身体的欺凌包括用手比划和语言欺凌，例如把手假装成枪射击特需生作为玩乐的游戏，特需生(尤其是孤独症谱系人士)对此没有反应，不知道自己在遭受欺凌。语言上的欺凌包括但不限于说： “笨蛋” “有病” ，在厕所门上写特需生的坏话等。 监护人如何发现心智障碍者受到校园欺凌? \n如何发现心智障碍者受到校园欺凌情绪上：谈及某个人感到害怕、暴躁、不安；害怕上学；有退化行为(如尿床)身体上：有伤痕、淤青等。 \n\n个人物品：作业本、书本、衣服等有人为损坏的痕迹。 监护人可以做什么监护人需要细心观察，有效跟心智障碍者沟通，了解发生了什么，如果真的发生被欺凌的情况，一定要报告，一定要处理，但绝不是以暴制暴的方式。 \n-方面教育智障}者学自์ R ,远离x自己友善的Л;另-方面需要理智地跟老师、甚至是实施欺凌学生的家长去沟通。 \n尤其要与老师共同建立在心智障碍者心中的信任感和安全感,建议老师采取一些措施来应对班级中的欺凌现象。 \n(部分内容选自卢莹女士的经验分享) 当然，并不是所有特需生都是遭受欺凌的对象，有些欺凌是特需生实施的，这些欺凌包括但不限于用手或其他物品攻击同学、破坏学校财产、偷拿同学和老师的物品、在其他同学的书上本子上乱画、吐口水、骂脏话、脱裤子露出隐私部位等。 特需学生也可能是欺凌的实施者还有些情况是有情绪或行为障碍的学生，可能难以理解某些行为的性质或把握尺度，对同学做出一些不当或过激的行为，虽然不一定是故意，但如果真的对其他人造成了伤害或损害等不良后果，监护人也是需要承担责任的。 \n(选自王建丽女士相关资料整理) 发现校园欺凌现象,老师可以做什么？ 事前预防在班级内，预防校园欺凌最重要的，是班主任要在班里建立正向正气的班风，明确班级规则,让学生明确知道班里倡导什么反对什么。 \n班主任平时对待每个学生的态度、对每件事的看法和做法会直接影响班里学生如何对待其他同学，所以班主任自身要有明确的是非观，平时多表扬学生正向的行为，对于欺凌行为，在有苗头时就要严厉制止，预防愈演愈烈，坚决制止恃强凌弱的行为。 \n班主任和科任教师在平时要营造一种尊重多元、团结友爱的班级氛围，同时对于特需学生多一些关注和耐心，当然又不能搞特殊，尽量在纪律方面一致要求。给特需学生安排品行端正的结对小伙伴,提高其社交技能和参与度,不仅可以帮助特需学生融入学校生活，还能预防欺凌。 \n用专门时间(例如班会)使用绘本、角色扮演、讨论等形式，对班级平时出现的问题进行教学，教导学生正确看待不同的人和处理同学关系的方法。要使用情境式体验式的教学方法，不用说教的方法。 \n邀请专业人士例如专门处理校园欺凌事件的律师，对学生和父母进行必要的法制教育，教导学生和父母分清欺凌行为和一般玩闹行为之间的区别，使用案例让学生和父母明白实施欺凌行为的严重后果，有可能会有出警记录，严重的还会负法律责任。 事中干预立即严厉制止实施欺凌的行为，检查被欺凌学生的伤情，让实施欺凌的学生道歉，警告实施欺凌的学生不能有下一次。 事后教育要一对一严厉告诉实施欺凌者这种行为不对，属于违法行为，注意要态度严厉，语气低沉,不要使用尖锐高挑的声音,注意语言文明,不能辱骂学生，更不能在全班面前用类似于批斗的方式对待实施欺凌的学生。 \n教导被欺凌学生应对欺凌的方法,例如,辨别哪些是欺凌行为，走路时绕开经常实施欺凌的同学，被欺凌时大声呼救，求助老师。 \n注意要预防下一次的欺凌发生,例如,派结对小伙伴跟随被欺凌的同学,找出欺凌经常发生的时间地点规律，老师要通过提前出现在欺凌地点、调整实施欺凌学生与被欺凌学生同时去洗手间的时间、调换座位、站队时将二人分开、及时发现欺凌行为的苗头并制止等方法预防欺凌的发生对障碍程度重的心智障碍学生，有哪些避免被欺凌的有效办法中度及中重度障碍学生进入普校学习，提高其个人应对校园欺凌的技能可能比较有限，所以有效的办法可以包括: \n\n老师引导学生正确认识对待不一样的同学，建立融洽、友好的班级氛围。老师要经常出现在学生容易受欺凌的场所，及时发现和阻止欺凌行为，给实施欺凌行为的学生以足够的震慑力。 \n\n为特需学生安排助学小伙伴，在必要的时候提供保护。 \n\n如果有条件的话，可以配备特教助理教师. \n(选自王建丽女士相关资料整理) 03
